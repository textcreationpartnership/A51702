            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TRuth is the proper object of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which when ſanctified, reliſhes Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Truths with a ſtrange delight and pleaſure, <hi>Job 12.11.</hi> The ſoul in all its laborious reſearche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and diſquiſitions (ſometimes climbing up from the Effects to the Cauſes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deſcending from the Cauſes to the Effects) is making enquiry after Truth.</p>
            <p>It racks and tortures it ſelf upon knotty Problems to find it out, and with vehement anhelations, and inſatiable longings, followes the pleaſant (though painfull) chaſe of Truth. All the objections, doubts, and ſcruples it meets with, are but the pauſes of a bivious and heſitateing ſoul, which is at a ſtand, not able to reſolve whether Truth lie on this ſide, or on that. And as its deſires are vehement in the purſuit of Truth, ſo is its joy proportionate in the acquiſition thereof. For no ſooner doth the Underſtanding diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, but the ſoul runs to it as it were with open arms,
<pb facs="tcp:110122:3"/>to embrace, hug, and welcome it. And though Truth be welcome in any dreſs to a ſoul that loves it for its native excellency, yet it may be clothed with ſuch taking circumſtances and conſiderations, as may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the ſoul with greater advantage, and be to a truth what health is to a good feature, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ammels and ſprinkles it over with a raviſhing beauty.</p>
            <p>Now amongſt all thoſe beautifying and endearing circumſtances and conſiderations, that of <hi>ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi> is not the leaſt. If it be a <hi>preſent truth,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it <hi>2 Pet. 1.12.</hi> it is for that the more gracefull and highly acceptable, becauſe it bears upon the ſouls preſent occaſions, and is of preſent uſe and ſervice to it. Prov. <hi>15.23. A word ſpoken in due ſeaſon, how good it is?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, under this great advantage (for I can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow no other ornaments upon them) do the truths of Jeſus, held forth in the following Treatiſe, preſent and commend themſelves to thine acceptance. If therefore thou be an ingenuous ſoul, that loveſt the Truth as it is in Jeſus, thou wilt entertain theſe Truths in love, which make as ſeaſonable an offer to aſſiſt and relieve thy ſoul engaged in this hour of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, as <hi>Joab</hi> once did to <hi>Abiſhai</hi> in the day of battel, <hi>1 Chron. 19.12.</hi> It may poſſibly prove a caſtly Truth to thee; but be confident it will pay thee richly for its entertainment. That great Truth which in the following diſcourſe is commended to thee, is the ſame which God is now preaching to all the world in a louder dialect by his preſent dreadfull diſpenſations. Say Reader, Do they not all with one mouth call upon us to prepare for fiery Trials? Is there not a dreadfull ſound of approaching judgements in thine ears? and will they not be by ſo much the more ſinking and intolerable,
<pb facs="tcp:110122:3"/>as they come by way of ſurprize upon thee? Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed evils are the more comportable. For look as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation deflowreth any temporal enjoyment, and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out much of the ſweetneſs of it beforehand, we find ſo much the leſs when we come to enjoy it, even ſo the expectation of evils abateth much of their dread and terrour. They ſeem not new or ſtrange to a perſon that hath often converſed with them before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in his thoughts; and beſides that, hath had the advantage of fortifying and preparing his ſpirit for them. When the Keepers Wife came running into Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi>'s Chamber, ſaying, O Mr. <hi>Bradford!</hi> I bring you heavy tidings, for to morrow you muſt be burned, your Chain is now buying, and preſently you muſt go to <hi>Newgate.</hi> He put off his Hat, and looking up to Heaven, ſaid, <hi>O Lord, I thank thee for it, I have looked for this a long time: it comes not ſuddenly to me, the Lord make me worthy of it.</hi> See in this example the rare advantage of preparation for ſufferings.</p>
            <p>Believe it Reader, Sufferings are a very bitter Cup, and thou hadſt need to provide ſome ſweething thing to drop into that Cup, that thou mayeſt be able to receive it with thanksgiving. And though it be true, that God may immediately do that for thee when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers it into thine hand, yet if thou <hi>neglect</hi> his calls to thy <hi>preſent duty,</hi> thou haſt no ground to <hi>expect</hi> ſuch a mercy in thy <hi>future ſtreights.</hi> It is an excellent thing for a Chriſtian to prepare for trials, as if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no immediate aſſiſtance; and then when the trial comes ſo entirely to depend upon immediate aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as if he had made no preparation for it. It grieves my heart to ſee how the generality of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of this Age are ſeized by a Spirit of ſlumber,
<pb facs="tcp:110122:4"/>and having got a ſoft Pillow of Creature-comforts under their heads, are fallen aſleep, and
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mundus erſceus ſpatitur phantaſias.</hi> Gerſon.</note> dream pleaſant dreams of Halcyon golden dayes at hand, not conſidering what ſtorms or tempeſts muſt uſher in the glory of that day, nor making proviſion to grapp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e with the intercurrent difficulties that ſo nearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them, and are their next work. That God will appear in his glory to build up <hi>Sion.</hi> And that the <hi>New</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall come down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride for her Husband</hi> is no dream, but a moſt certain and comfortable truth, but that therefore it is needleſs for the Expectants of that day to make themſelves ready for the worſt of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; that they may aſcend in a fiery Chariot into the glorious Kingdome above, not knowing whether ever they may live to ſee this New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> come down to them: this I ſay is a dream which will be of ill uſe to the Saints, except the Lord ſeaſonably awake them out of it. If this ſpirit of ſlumber, which our Lord hath fore-ſhewen ſhall fall even upon the Virgin Churches at the laſt dayes,
<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>25.</hi>
               </note> have not invaded thee, but thou ſtandeſt with <hi>Habakkuk</hi> upon thy <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi> expecting and fitting thy ſelf for a day of greater tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation and trouble; ſuch a diſcourſe cannot but be welcome to thee, and thou wilt bleſs God for affording thee any help in ſo important an affair as this is. Thou art not at all the nearer death for laying thy head vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntartly upon the Block, God can provide himſelf another ſacrifice, and yet accept thy readineſs to ſuffer for him as if thy blood had been actually ſhed. This will reflect much honour upon Jeſus Chriſt in the ſight of the world, to whom it will hereby appear, that there is a reality in godlineſs, and that you do indeed deſcry ſomething beyond theſe preſent viſible enjoyments, that
<pb facs="tcp:110122:4"/>infinitely preponderates and excells them all. And as Chriſt will be magnified, ſo a double benefit will hence reſult to thy ſelf. Hereby thou wilt gain <hi>peace</hi> in thy ſpirit, and a <hi>proof</hi> of thy ſpirit. Peace of ſpirit in dayes of confuſion and perplexity is no ſmall mercy. This is ordinarily the effect and reward of a wiſe and provident preparation for them, <hi>I trembled in my ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, that I might reſt in the day of trouble,</hi> Hab. <hi>3.16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this will alſo give thee a proof of thy ſpirit. Upon this account (Chriſtian) they may be the beſt days that ever thou ſaweſt. Now thou mayeſt diſcover not onely the <hi>truth</hi> but the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of thy graces; being called unto ſome high points of <hi>ſelf-deniall</hi> for Chriſt. For look as <hi>ſelf-love</hi> is not onely a <hi>ſin,</hi> but the <hi>meaſure</hi> of all other ſins, ſo ſelf-deniall is not onely a <hi>grace,</hi> but the true <hi>meaſure</hi> and touch-ſtone of all thy graces. Now in order to thy attainment of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and choice frame of Spirit, the eying of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples as theſe cannot but be of ſingular uſe. Here you have a Cloud of Witneſſes. And the Cloud en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſeth you round. Turn which way you will, you may find ſomething in them parallel to your caſe.

            <p>But certainly, our applauſe and commendation of them, is not all the uſe that God expects you ſhould make uſe of them, but that you ſhould be <hi>followers of them, who through Faith and patience inherits the Promiſes;</hi> and that you <hi>take them for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſuffering affliction and of patience,</hi> Heb. <hi>6.12.</hi> Jam. <hi>5.10.</hi> It's ſtoried of great <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> that he never went into the Field, but he

               <q>Then <hi>Paul</hi> anſwered, What mean ye to weep, and to break mine heart? for I am ready, not to be bound onely, but alſo to die at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſeveral motions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were guided by the ſpecial direction of the Holy Ghoſt. They could not go where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they had a mind to go, but where the Spirit pleaſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and carry them, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.6, 7. At this time <hi>Paul</hi> ſtood engaged by the ſpecial direction of the Spirit, to go to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> Act. 20.22. <hi>And now behold I go bound in the Spirit to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>not knowing the things that ſhall befall me there.</hi> [bound in the Spirit] It's an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as ſome conceive, to a priſoner, that is bound with Cords, and carryed away by a potent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour: Or, as others, to the Watery Vapours, which are bound up in the Clouds, and carrved by the Wind, according to the motion of the Clouds. Even ſo, was the Spirit of this Holy Man effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued and determined to his Duty, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the hazards attending it, that he could no more keep himſelf back from his duty, to which the Spirit ſo ſtrongly impell'd him, than a man that is wedged in with a Crowd can chuſe but move as it moves. So powerfully doth the Spirit of the Lord,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110122:7"/>by his convictions and ſecret perſwaſions, ſubdue and determine the Spirits of the Saints to the Work God hath to do by them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.20.</p>
            <p>And it was well that the Will of God, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this dangerous Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was ſo convincingly revealed unto <hi>Paul:</hi> For ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he met with three ſtrange Rubs in his way, able to have ſtagger'd any man that had not an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary degree of clearneſs and ſatisfaction in his own Spirit.</p>
            <p>The firſt was from the Diſciples at <hi>Tyre,</hi> who pretending to ſpeak to <hi>Paul</hi> by the Spirit, ſaid unto him, <hi>that he ſhould not go up to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.4. The Lord by this trying the Spirit of his Apoſtle, much as he did the young Prophet coming from <hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>Bethel,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.18.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this, he met with another great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> where <hi>Agabus</hi> (whom <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotheus</hi> ſaith was one of the 72 Diſciples, and had before propheſied of the Famine in the time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> which accordingly came to paſs) he takes <hi>Paul</hi>'s Girdle, and binding his own hands and feet with it, ſaid, <hi>Thus ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, ſo ſhall the</hi> Jews <hi>at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>bind the man that oweth this girdle, and ſhall deliver him into the hands of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.11. And he well enough knew, what the rage and malice both of the one and other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him was, and what he muſt expect, if ever he fell into their hands.</p>
            <p>And then laſtly, he meets with a greater diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and pull-back then any of the forme, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that paſſionate ſtorm of affection and love wherewith his Friends aſſault him, begging him with tears to decline that Journey. Oh they could not give up ſuch a Miniſter as <hi>Paul</hi> was, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110122:7"/>fell upon him with their pathetical Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and multitudes of Tears, which even melted him down, and almoſt brake his heart.</p>
            <p>Whence, by the way, you may note, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge our ſelves diſcharged from any ſervice by God, becauſe we meet with ſtrange hinderances, and croſs providences in our way. Divine <hi>Precept,</hi> not <hi>Providence,</hi> is to rule out our way of Duty. Never man met with ſorer ſet-backs and remora's then <hi>Paul</hi> here did; but notwithſtanding all this, being fully ſatisfied, it was the Lords will he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that ſervice at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he reſolutely breaks through all thoſe intercurrent difficulties, with this heroick and truly Chriſtian Reſolution in the Text, <hi>I am ready not to be bound onely, but to die at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for</hi> Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The words conſiſt of two general parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Paul</hi>'s loving and gentle rebuke of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples inordinate and unſeaſonable ſorrow for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. What do ye? Or, as it's ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, What mean ye? Pray forbear your tears, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain your unruly paſſion; if you continue thus, I ſhall not die at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for Chriſt indeed, you'l break my heart here. The words in the <hi>Greek</hi> are emphatical, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>comminventes,</hi> breaking it all to pieces, crumbling it into duſt. Oh what a temptation was this? but it moved him not from his purpoſe. They had even <hi>broken,</hi> but could not <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> his heart from the Work of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Conſiderations or Argument he uſeth to quiet them, <hi>For I am ready,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I am in a ready poſture, fitted for the Work, be it a <hi>Priſon,</hi> or be it <hi>Death.</hi> Liberty is a dear thing, the very Birds of the Air had rather be in the Woods with their liberty, though lean and hungry, than in a Golden Cage with the beſt attendance, ſaith one: But I am
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110122:8"/>fitted for Bonds, ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> Nay, that's not all, but I am ready alſo to <hi>die</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> To part with life is the higheſt point of Self-denial, becauſe all lower Self-Intereſts in the World, are as it were twiſted with, and wrapt up in this Intereſt of Life. He that is ready to deny his life for Chriſt, is alſo ready to ſacrifice all other, even his deareſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for him alſo, becauſe theſe are all wrapt up in Life: Yet for this he profeſſeth to them he was ready.</p>
            <p>But what was in this to ſatisfie them whoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it was to ſee him ſo forward: Why there are three things hereby ſuggeſted to them, in order to the calming of their ſpirits.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In this they might ſee a Divine Hand that had been at work upon his heart, fitting it thus for that ſervice: for certainly fleſh and blood could not produce this: And if it were of God, there was reaſon enough for them to be quiet, and not ſtrive againſt God: For there is nothing in the World will ſooner ſtill and quiet a gracious Soul than this, to ſhew him how God hath ſignified his Will in the thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am ready, my heart ſtands fully bent to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and therefore you had as good be quiet, and ſatisfie your ſelves, for I am fixt and reſolved upon it: my Will is ſubdued to the obedience of the Divine Will in this thing: your Tears and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties are all in vain, 'twill be but loſt labour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As it would be in vain to them, he reſolving not to gratifie them in that, ſo it would be of very ill uſe to him. I am now ready (ſaith he) God hath fully ſatisfied my Soul in the thing: and not onely am I clear in this that it is my duty, but in a good meaſure I am fitted for it. I have overcome the Contradictions and Reluctations of the Fleſh, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110122:8"/>brought my heart to a quiet ſubmiſſion to the Will of God. It is therefore as great a diſſervice as you can imagine to do me. Now to unfix and diſorder my heart again, by caſting ſuch Temptations as theſe in my way, and by your tempting Tears to make the fleſh rebel, and the Enemy that is within to renew its oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the equipage and preparation of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Spirit for Chriſt's ſervice at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And as this was not a bravado before he ſaw the Enemy, but real and in earneſt, appears by his acting full up to this his noble Reſolution, when it came to the tryal, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 7. So that it was a very glorious and excellent Spirit, by which he did exceedingly glorifie the Lord: and this readineſs of Spirit was of ſingular uſe alſo to himſelf, for this enabled him to break his way through the many and ſtrange hinderances and diſcouragements that he met withall in that Journey.</p>
            <p>Now though the Text be pregnant, with many excellent and uſeful Notes, yet the main Point that I level at is this.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>DOCT.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is a bleſſed and excellent thing for the people of God to be ready for the hardeſt ſervices, and worſt ſufferings, to which the Lord may call them.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>This is that which every gracious heart is reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, and aiming at, but how few attain it? Certainly, there are not many that can ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> here did, <hi>I am ready to be bound, or die.</hi>

<note place="margin">Why he calls his people to ſuch grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> and bring them to theſe exigencies, may be drawn partly from his own <hi>Glory,</hi> which is thereby ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary <hi>illuſtrated,</hi> and partly from his peoples <hi>good,</hi> which is alſo thereby ſtrangely promoted and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110122:14"/>Heaven will be little the fuller for this ſtrange multiplication of them: And this I ſuppoſe is the ground of that ſaying, <hi>That it's never better with the Church, then when it hath moſt Hypocrites in it.</hi> But now Perſecution like a windy day cauſes all this rotten Fruit to fall. <hi>Lightning</hi> and <hi>Thunder</hi> is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weather, but it purifies and cleanſeth the Air, Some of theſe ſeem to be very beautiful Flowers in the Field of the Church, where they ſtand (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Sun-ſhine of Peace) in the Pride and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their Profeſſions and Gifts; <hi>but the wind paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth over them and they are gone, and their places ſhall know them no more.</hi> To allude to that in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 103.16.</p>

You have two pregnant inſtances of this, <hi>Acts</hi> 43.2. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. Certainly there is ſomething that is engaging, in <hi>fellowſhip</hi> in the ſame Sufferings. But there is much more in the <hi>diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> that Perſecution makes of their ſincerity, which it may be was before entertained with jealouſie. And there is yet more, in the <hi>reproofs</hi> of the Rod, whereby they are taught the evil of their former wayes, and made to cry, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.8. <hi>Oremember not againſt us former iniquities.</hi>

But now, they cry as the Diſciples to Chriſt, when ready to ſink in the Storm, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26, 16. <hi>O Lord, in trouble they have viſited
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110122:14"/>thee: they have poured out a Prayer when thy chaſtning was upon them.</hi> Now they pray more humbly, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, fervently.

               <p>Theſe few Hints may ſuffice to ſhew you the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Fruits which God aims at in exerciſing his people under afflictions, and what one of theſe ſingly may not preponderate all the ſmart and pain they coſt you.

               <p>NOw to evince the Choiceneſs and Excellency of a ready and prepared Spirit to entertain, and chearfully obey a call from God to the greateſt Sufferings, thereby to ſet an edge upon your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and quicken your Endeavours after it; be pleaſed to ponder theſe following Particulars, wherein much of its Excellency will appear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It will bring the heart to an holy Reſt and Quietude in a Suffering hour, and ſo prevent that Anxiety and perturbation of Spirit, which puts the ſinking weight into Affliction. The more Care, Fear, and Trouble thou haſt before a Trouble comes, the more Calm, Quiet, and Compoſed thy Spirit will be when the Affliction is come indeed. It is admirable to conſider with what peace and holy ſubmiſſion <hi>Job</hi> entertain'd his Troubles, which conſidering the kind and <hi>quality</hi> of them, together
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110122:15"/>with the <hi>manner</hi> in which they befell him, one would think they ſhould (at leaſt) have ſtartled and amazed him, and put his Soul (though gracious) into a ſtrange Confuſion: But you ſee the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he is very quiet and compoſed in his Spirit, little Tumult or Diſorder appears in his Thoughts, but he worſhips God, owns his Hand, and ſubmits to his Will, <hi>Job</hi> 1.20, 21. Whence was this? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had they come by way of <hi>Surprize,</hi> as holy as he was he could not have carried it thus; but he had in the dayes of his Peace and Proſperity prepared for ſuch a Day as this, and ſo they neither came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly, nor found him unprepared for them, <hi>Job</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>I was not in ſafety, neither had I reſt, yet trouble came.</hi> The thing which he <hi>feared</hi> (as he ſaith there) <hi>came upon him.</hi> He laid it to heart before it came, and therefore it neither brake nor diſtracted his heart when it came.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Habakkuk</hi> he ſtood upon his Watch-Tower, <hi>i. e. receſſum mentis,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Calvin;</hi> his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring Thoughts, making Obſervations from the Word upon probable Events. Yea, and ſeeing a Storm of Judgement gathering in the Clouds of the Threatnings, he trembled in himſelf before it fell, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.16, 17. And ſee what advantage this was of to him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17.18. he had <hi>Reſt</hi> in the Day of Trouble; yea could <hi>rejoyce,</hi> when all outward Staves and comforts were gone. There is a double Reſt in the Day of Evil; a Reſt of <hi>Deliverance,</hi> and a Reſt of <hi>Contentation;</hi> it was this later that this holy man enjoyed in that Evil Day, and that as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of his ſerious Preparation.</p>

We may not conclude Reſt and Peace from the Report our Senſes make to us, from the poſture of ſecond Cauſes, (and yet what is there, look which way you will, but ſpeaks Troubles and Diſtreſſes coming upon the World) but rather we ſhould make a Judgment from the Word, upon condition of the Times; for there you have the Decrees of God, and a Draught of the Deſigns of Providence, to the end of the World, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.1, 2. Here you may ſee <hi>the Signs of the Times,</hi> and what days are to be expected. And then, if you can upon this fore-ſight, get into your <hi>Ark</hi> before the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of Heaven be opened, and the Sea-Shores unbar'd, and the Waters prevail above the Mountains; Oh what a benefit will this be! how mayſt thou ſit (<hi>Noah</hi> like) <hi>medius tranquillus in undis!</hi> Safe from the fear of evil, and enjoy reſt and peace in thy own
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110122:16"/>Spirit, when the Earth is full of Uproars, Tumults, and Deſolations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a bleſſed and excellent thing to prepare for ſufferings, becauſe ſuch preparations do plainly ſpeak a truly gracious heart, that is in earneſt with Chriſt, and is ſerious in the matters of Religion. Believe it Soul, this one thing will be the cleareſt diſcovery of the integrity of thy heart in profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He that makes account of ſufferings, and is ſeriouſly at work upon his own heart, to fit it for ſufferings, and take his Lot with Chriſt where ever it falls, this is the man that hath deliberately cloſed with Chriſt upon his own terms, and is like to be the durable Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>As for Hypocrites (Chriſts Summer-Friends) they have either their Exceptions and ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, to ſecure a Retreat, if ever it come to hot ſervice, or elſe they ruſh inconſiderately into the profeſſion of Chriſt, never examining the terms which he propoſes to all that will follow him, nor ſealing thoſe Indentures, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34. upon which he onely allows us to call him Maſter.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of a rational and adviſed cloſure with Chriſt upon theſe terms, is by himſelf fully ſet forth in that excellent Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.25, 26, 27, 28. wherein conſider, (1.) The occaſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>There were great Multitudes with him,</hi> Chriſt began to grow in requeſt among them, they flockt from all parts to him, to hear him; but Chriſt knew well enough, that if once they ſhould come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their work, and what the Conditions and Terms of their admiſſion into his ſervice are, it would quickly thin and diminiſh that great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and reduce that great Hoſt like <hi>Gideons,</hi> into a little handful. (2.) And therefore he reſolves candidly and plainly with them: and in <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110122:16"/>he propounds his Terms, and writes down his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, the ſum of which is this, <hi>he muſt deny himſelf,</hi> that is, at leaſt <hi>in praeparatione animi,</hi> in the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind, if not actually: So that this is the Hinge upon which all our Profeſſion turns, and the ſtreſs of the whole buſineſs lies. And (3.) to evince the rationality of his Terms, and that he expected no unreaſonable thing at their hand, he clears it by a double inſtance, or reſemblance, to what men uſe to do in other caſes. (1.) That of a <hi>Builder,</hi> no man that exerciſeth Reaſon will begin to build an Houſe, and not be provided to defray the Charge of it: It were a ridiculous vanity, for a man to lay a large Foundation, and not have a ſtock to carry up the Walls, and compleat the Work. (2.) That of a <hi>Souldier,</hi> no man would with 10000. engage an Army of 20000. that would be <hi>impar congreſſus,</hi> an unequal Match indeed; what could he expect but to be overpowred with Numbers, and ſwallowed up? Poſſibly they may intend to <hi>face,</hi> but no man would think they intended to <hi>fight</hi> the Enemy on ſuch a diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>Why thus ſtands the caſe, In our ingaging in the Profeſſion of Chriſt, a man muſt ſit down and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the coſt and charges of being a Chriſtian, and deliberately weigh the worſt, as well as the beſt; and having ſo done, if then he be content to run all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards with Jeſus Chriſt, and expects to ſave no more but his Soul, (for indeed he that thinks to ſave any thing but his Soul by <hi>Religion,</hi> is a Fool for ſo think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing). If I ſay he be content to fore-go and hazard all the reſt for Chriſt and accordingly when dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers appear, and difficult times come on, doth in good earneſt fit and make ready himſelf for the worſt he can fore-ſee, why this is the man, that deals honeſtly with Chriſt, and is ſincere, hearty,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110122:17"/>and reall in his Tranſactions with him. For want of this conſideration at firſt, and ſuitable preparations from time to time, as need requires, and new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles approach; I ſay, for want of this it is, that ſo many faint and fall back in the day of trouble, and furniſh Hell with ſo many Tryumphs over Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ſincere-hearted Profeſſors of it. It was for want of <hi>depth of Earth, (i. e.)</hi> a deep conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and rooted Reſolution at firſt, that the Stony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground Hypocrite ſo quickly withered, when the Sun of Perſecution began to ſhine fervently upon him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.5, 6.</p>
               <p>And wherefore is it think you? that God doth make ſuch deep Wounds by Conviction upon mens hearts at firſt, and terrifie them with ſuch dreadful Repreſentations of their guilt, in the Glaſs of the Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. Why ſurely, as God aims at the unbortoming of the Man by this, and ſtriking him off that falſe and conceited Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his own Righteouſneſs, ſo he doth it to make Chriſts Terms and Conditions appear ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and eaſie to him, that being delivered out of that miſerable ſtate by Chriſt, he may never open his mouth grudgingly and repiningly againſt Chriſt, whatever Troubles he ſhall from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward meet with for his ſake, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.63.</p>
               <p>So that it muſt needs be a good proof and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, of the ſincerity of our hearts, in the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, when we thus fit our ſelves to ſuffer with him, and are content to bear his Croſs, as well as wear his Crown: And is it not a bleſſed thing, for a man to find a fair Evidence of this in his own heart? What can be more comfortable to him on Earth?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This preparation is an excellent thing, becauſe it's that which prevents and cuts off the ſcandal of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110122:17"/>the Croſs, and the offence that others take at the ſufferings of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now, by Chriſts own Teſtimony, that Soul is bleſſed that is not offended in him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.6. And truly, there are not many among the Throng of Profeſſors, upon whoſe Heads this bleſſing falls; how many in a ſuffering hour, are diſguiſed as perſons that have met with a diſappointment? They expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted much peace, honour, and proſperity, from Chriſt, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.20, 21. but finding now their Expectations fruſtrated, and their Carnal Intereſts rather <hi>expoſed,</hi> then <hi>ſecured</hi> by their profeſſion of him, they go back like thoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.66. and walk no more with him. And it is very obſervable, that Chriſt dates the offence that men ſhall take at him, from the beginning of ſorrows, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.8, 9. <hi>All theſe are the beginning of ſorrows, and then ſhall many be offended.</hi> This is the beginning of Apoſtacy from Chriſt. But now if thou be one that makeſt it thy buſineſs, to fore-ſee and provide for Troubles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come upon thee, this will prevent thy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence when they come, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.1, 2, 3, 4. Fore-ſight of them takes off both the <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> and <hi>terrour</hi> of them. <hi>Great peace</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>have they that love thy Law, and [nothing] ſhall [offend] them;</hi> or, <hi>be a ſtumbling block to them,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Heb.</hi> No! Why they meet with Priſons, Death, Baniſhments, yea, but they ſhall not ſtumble or be offended at theſe things, but paſs peaceably over them, becauſe they meet with no more then they expected.</p>
               <p>And is not this a bleſſed thing, think you, that whatever falls out in thy way ſhall not offend thee, or make any alteration on thy Judgment of Chriſt and his ways, but he ſhall be as lovely, and his ways as ſweet and deſirable under Perſecution, Scorn, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110122:18"/>Contempt, as in the greateſt flouriſh of Proſperity? Yea, though thou be <hi>broken in the place of Dragons, and covered with the ſhadow of Death, yet ſhall not thy heart be turned back, nor thy ſteps decline from his ways,</hi> Pſal. 44.18, 19, 20. Why, this bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes upon the heart of the prepared Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth Excellency of preparation for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings lies in this, that it hath a tendency to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and awaken the ſecure and drowſie World. O! If the Lords people would but fall about this work in earneſt, and live as people that are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for a Storm, and reſolved in the ſtrength of God to run all hazards and hardſhips for Chriſt, I am perſwaded it would be of more eaſe to ſtartle and convince the World, then all the Sermons that ever they heard. For here is that which daſhes and cuts the Throat of all our Labours; we preach up Self-denial and Contempt of Life and Liberty for Chriſt. Now though they hear us preach the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and excellency of theſe things, and here you profeſs them as your Principles; yet when they look upon the Lives of Profeſſors in Times of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and find no proportion betwixt your profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practice, when they ſee you cling to the World, and are as loth to give it up as others; that Priſons and Sufferings are as formidable things to you as others, and that you live not looſe from theſe things, as men that are in a preparedneſs to let them go, and give them up for Chriſt: Why then they conclude, that you dare not truſt your own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples when it comes to the puſh; and how can they be perſwaded to believe, that which they think your ſelves do not really believe? They have <hi>Eyes</hi> to <hi>ſee</hi> what you can <hi>do,</hi> as well as <hi>Ears</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> what you can <hi>ſay;</hi> and as long as they ſee you do no more
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:110122:18"/>then others, you may talk your hearts out, e're they will believe your way is better than others.</p>
               <p>But now when Perſecution ariſeth, did they ſee you providing your ſelves for it, and putting on your Harneſs to enter the Liſts, carry your deareſt Enjoyments in your hands, and put on the ſhooe of preparation, to follow the Lord through the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wayes of Sufferings: this would convince to purpoſe, and preach the excellency of Chriſt, the vanity of the Creature, the rationality and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtian Principles, in a more intelligible and rouzing Dialect to them, than all our cheap and eaſie Commendations of them did. And hence it is, that <hi>Noah</hi> was ſaid to condemn the World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>By Faith</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God, of things not ſeen as yet, (i. e.)</hi> of the Deluge that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though no appearance of it yet, the Heavens being as clear as ever: yet believing the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>he was moved with fear:</hi> the fear of God, an effect of his Faith in the Word of God, <hi>moved, (i.e.)</hi> impelled him to his Duty: Set him about his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration-work, to provide an <hi>Ark;</hi> and this was it by which he <hi>condemned the World,</hi> left them excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: For they not onely heard of an approaching Flood by his Miniſtry, but now ſaw he himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved what he preached, by his daily preparations againſt it came. O conſider this, how much it would tend to the Worlds Conviction. Now they will ſee that you are in good earneſt, and that there is a reality in godlineſs. This will induce them to ſearch into the matter more then ever, and remove thoſe prejudices they have taken up againſt the good ways of God, as if they were but <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms</hi> and Conceits.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the next place, this fore-ſight and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, muſt needs be an excellent thing, becauſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110122:19"/>the Spirit of God every where ſets an honourable Character upon it, and always mentions ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with ſome ſingular commendation and reſpect. Theſe onely are the Wiſe-men in the Judgment of God; and all the reſt (what great Polititians ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are famed to be among men) are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Fools, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The Wiſe-mans Eyes are in his head;</hi> that is, he is a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing man; <hi>but the Fool goes on and is puniſhed:</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes on without conſideration, ſuſpecting no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that he at preſent ſees not, and ſo ſmarts for his folly. Beloved, there are <hi>Signs of the Times,</hi> as well as of the Weather, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.3. You may ſee the Clouds of Judgment gathering before the Storm falls upon you: And this is the meaning of <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Gather your ſelves together, before the Deerce bring forth, and the Day paſs as the Chaff.</hi> Where there is a <hi>Conception</hi> of Judgment, there will be a <hi>Firth,</hi> unleſs the Reformations and Prayers of the Saints give it a miſcarrying Womb. But it requires Wiſdom to diſcern this; they muſt be men of much obſervation, that can deſcry it at a great diſtance: yet this may be done, by conſidering what GOD hath done in like Caſes in former Ages, when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been guilty of the ſame ſins as now they are: For God is as juſt now as then, and hates ſin as much as ever he did; and partly, by attending to things <hi>preſent,</hi> to what fulneſs and maturity the ſins of a Nation are grown, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.16. or what <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings</hi> of Judgment are already upon a people, as Harbingers and Fore-runners of more at hand, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.30, 31. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.12. Or what is the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Vote and Cry of Gods Miniſters, who are his Watch-men to fore-ſee danger, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17. and his Trumpeters to diſcover it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.8. and when theſe have one mouth given, certainly there
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110122:19"/>is much in it, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.70. Or laſtly, by pondering thoſe Scripture-Prophecies that yet remain to be fulfilled: They muſt all go out their times, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their full number of Years and Moneths; but certainly they ſhall be fulfilled in their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>By attending to theſe things, a Chriſtian may give a near gueſs at the Judgments that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching a Nation, and ſo order himſelf accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.5. <hi>A wiſe mans heart diſcerns both time and judgment.</hi> And this is (even in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God) a choice point of Wiſdom. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, heedleſs and careleſs ones, that regard not theſe things, are branded for Fools, and upbraided with more bruitiſhneſs than the Beaſts of the Field, or Fowls of the Air, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The Stork in the Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Swallow, Turtle,</hi> and <hi>Crane,</hi> obſerve their Seaſons of departing, and returning, upon the approach of the <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Spring,</hi> and that by a natural inſtinct, whereby they prolong their lives, which elſe muſt periſh. But though God hath made Man wiſer then the Fowls of the Air, and Beaſts of the Earth, which by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct will quit colder Climates, or run to the Hedg when Winter or Storms approach, yet the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens may be aſtoniſhed at this, to ſee Nature caſt by ſinne ſo far below it ſelf, and that in reaſonable Creatures.</p>
               <p>But now, if this be fore-ſeen, then there is a ſingular advantage in a mans hand, either to uſe the means of preventing thoſe approaching Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. or if it cannot be prevented, yet to take Sanctuary in Chriſt, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.5. to run to the Promiſes and Attributes, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. <hi>ult.</hi> and ſo have a good Roof over his Head while the Storm falls, and the Weather is tempeſtuous abroad. And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110122:20"/>therefore certainly, this Preparation is an excellent thing. Whatever the Spirit of God ſpeaks in the commendation of fore-ſeeing Evils, is with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to this Duty of preparing for them; for fore-ſight of Evils, without preparation, rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, then diminiſhes the miſery.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A ſixth Excellency of Preparation, lies in the influence that it hath into a Chriſtians ſtability in the evil day. You cannot but know, that your ſtability in that <hi>critical hour</hi> of Temptation, is a choice and ſingular Mercy, in as much as all you are worth in the other World depends upon your ſtanding then, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.28. Neither can you be ignorant how much you are like to be tryed and put to it then, whether you reſpect the Enemy that engages you, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. or your own weakneſs, who have been ſo often foil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in leſſer tryals, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.5. All the Grace you have, will be little enough to keep the Field, and bear you up from ſinking; and therefore it cannot but be a bleſſed thing, to be able to ſtand and cope with the greateſt difficulties, in ſuch a nick of triall as that will be. Now he that expects to do this, muſt <hi>put on the whole Armour of God.</hi> See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12, 13, 14. There's no expectation of ſtanding in the evil day, except <hi>your feet be ſhod,</hi> that is, your Wills prepared, with the <hi>preparation of the Goſpel of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that our ability to ſtand, is not from our own inherent grace; <hi>for by his ſtrength ſhall no man prevail,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9. and yet it is as true, that without grace, both inherent in us, and excited and prepared for action, we cannot expect to ſtand: For theſe two, Grace inherent in us, and Grace exciting and aſſiſting without, are not <hi>oppoſed,</hi> but <hi>co-ordinated.</hi> Grace in us, is the Weapon by which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110122:20"/>our Enemy falls; but then that Weapon muſt be managed by the Hand of the Spirit.—Well then, look upon this as a choice mercy, which tends ſo much to your ſtability.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A ſeventh Excellency of a prepared Heart, is, that it is a very high teſtification of our love to Jeſus Chriſt, when we thus ſhew our willingneſs to take our Lot with him, and follow him whereever he goes. What an high expreſſion of love was that of <hi>Ruth,</hi> to her Mother <hi>Naomy; I will not go back, but where thou lodgeſt I will lodge, and where thou goeſt I will go.</hi> 'Tis excellent, when a Soul can ſay to Chriſt, as <hi>Ittai</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.21. <hi>Surely, in what place my Lord the King ſhall be, whether in Death, or in Life, even there alſo will thy Servant be.</hi> This is love indeed, to cleave to him in a time of ſuch diſtreſſes and dangers. This is <hi>love which the Waters cannot quench, nor the Flood drown,</hi> Cant. 8.6. <hi>Probatio amoris, eſt exhibitio operis:</hi> If you love Chriſt indeed, ſhew your love by ſome fruits of it; and ſurely, this is a very choice fruit and proof of it. There be many that profeſs a great deal of love to Chriſt, but when it comes to this Touch-ſtone, it appears falſe and counterfeit, but a meer flouriſh, when no danger is near: But that Soul which buckles on the Shooe of Preparation, to follow him through Thorns and Briars, and over the Rocks and Mountains of Difficulties and Troubles, loves him indeed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2, 3. Beloved, it's one of the choiceſt Diſcoveries of your love to your Maſter Chriſt; yea, it is ſuch a teſtification of love to him, as Angels are not capable of. They ſhew their love by their readineſs to do his Will, in the execution of which they fly as with Wings, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.24. But you onely have the happineſs of teſtifying your
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110122:21"/>love, by your readineſs to ſuffer for him, and is not this excellent?</p>
               <p n="8">8. When the Heart is prepared for the worſt Sufferings, it's an Argument that your Will is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to the Will of God; for till this be done in a good meaſure, you cannot ſtand ready to ſuffer for him: But now, to have the Will ſubdued by Grace to the Will of God, is a very choice and excellent frame indeed; for in this the main power of Grace lieth: Look in what Faculty the chief Reſidence and ſtrength of ſinne was, in the ſame, the chief Reſidence and power of Grace, after Converſion, is alſo: Now it is in the Will, that the ſtrength and power of ſinne (before Converſion) lay. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.16, 17. And indeed, it was the Devils ſtrong Hold, which in the Day of Chriſts Power, he ſtorms and reduces to his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. Oh what a bleſſed thing is this! the Will rules the Man, it hath the Empire of the whole Man, it commands the Faculties of the Soul, <hi>imperio politico;</hi> and it commands the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body, <hi>imperio deſpotico:</hi> Now to have Chriſt and Grace rule that, which rules and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands your inner and outer Man too, is no ſmall Mercy: And a better Evidence that it is ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given than this, that you ſtand ready, or do ſeriouſly prepare your ſelves to ſuffer the hardeſt things for Chriſt: If your Will can like that Work, it's an Argument Grace hath conquered and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued indeed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Preparation of Heart to Duty, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing, becauſe God is ſo abundantly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with it, that he oftens excuſes them from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in whom he finds it, and accepts it, as if the ſervice had been actually done. So <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:110122:21"/>22.12. he was ready to offer up his <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s life to God; but God ſeeing his Servants heart really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and ready for that difficult ſervice, and high point of Self-denial, provided himſelf another Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice inſtead of <hi>Iſaac. Abraham</hi> ſhall have his <hi>Iſaac</hi> back again, and that with advantage; for he hath with him not onely a choice Experiment of his love to God, but Gods high approbation of him, and acceptation of his Offering. It was all one, in reſpect of Divine acceptance, as if he had bin ſlain; and ſo the Scripture repreſents it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21. And in this ſenſe, that Promiſe is often made good to Gods People, who ſtand ready to give up their <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> their lives, liberties, and deareſt enjoyments, to the Lord; <hi>He that will loſe his life for my Names ſake ſhall ſave it,</hi> Luk. 9.24.</p>
               <p>Now what a bleſſed thing is this! you may this way have the Crown of Martyrdom, and yet not ſhed one drop of blood for Chriſt actually. Ah how kindly doth God accept it at his poor Creatures hands, when he ſees how willing they are to ſerve him with their beſt enjoyments! <hi>It is well</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>David) that it was in thy heart,</hi> 1 King. 8.18.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And then laſtly, to add no more, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Controverſie an excellent and bleſſed thing; becauſe ſhould ſuch a Chriſtian, after all his pains and preparations, be overborn, and fall by Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, yet this preparation of his heart excuſes his fall, from thoſe aggravations that are upon the falls of others, and will give him both <hi>ſupport</hi> under ſuch a condition, and <hi>encouragement</hi> to hope for a ſpeedy recovery out of it. Ah! it's no ſmall comfort, when a poor Soul that hath been overborn by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, can come to God and ſay, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that this was not a wilful departure from my duty, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:110122:22"/>contrary to the bent and reſolution of my heart, thou ſaweſt my diligence before-hand to prepare for it; thou ſaweſt my fears and tremblings of heart about it; O Lord forgive, O Lord recover thy Servant, waſh away this ſpot, it is one of the ſpots of thy children, an infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, not a Rebellion:</hi> This may much ſtay the Soul.</p>
               <p>Surely in this caſe, thou haſt many grounds of comfort that another wants: For thy ſin being but an infirmity, (1.) It's that which is common to all Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.11, 12, 13, 14. (2.) God hath mercy and pardons for ſuch ſins as theſe; elſe woe to the holieſt Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3, 4. <hi>Solomon,</hi> upon this ground, pleads for mercy for them that prepared their hearts, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18, 19. and God hath laid in ſweet grounds of encouragement for ſuch Souls, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.27, 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2. How tenderly doth Chriſt deal with the Diſciples under this kind of ſin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. and though they forſook him for a time, yet received them again! though they fled from him, yet they all returned again, and appeared boldly for Chriſt afterwards, and ſealed their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of him with their blood: and that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them again was this, that their fall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture was contrary to the reſolution and ſtanding frame and bent of their hearts; for they reſolved all to cleave to him to the death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.35. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thoſe that engaged in a profeſſion of him inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, and never reſolved nor prepared for the worſt, fell off from him, and never returned any more, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.66. So then, upon the whole, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but grant, that it is a very bleſſed and excellent thing, to prepare thus for the greateſt Sufferings that can befall us for Chriſt: We come next to ſhew wherein it lies.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Evincing the neceſſity of a ſound and reall work of grace upon the heart, to fit a man for the ſufferings of Chriſt.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving ſhewed you that God doth ſometimes put his deareſt people upon very hard ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for him, and what an excellent thing it is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves to obey the call of God to them; In the next place I come to ſhew you, wherein this <hi>preparation</hi> or <hi>readineſs</hi> for Sufferings conſiſts, and how many things concur and contribute their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to this Work.</p>
               <p>Now there is a two-fold <hi>preparation</hi> or <hi>readineſs</hi> for Suffering; the one is <hi>habitual,</hi> the other <hi>actual:</hi> That <hi>habitual readineſs</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of a Soul, to ſuffer any thing for Chriſt; which <hi>inclination</hi> ariſeth from the Principles of Grace infuſed into the Soul: But then as fire, though it have a natural inclination to aſcend, yet may be violently depreſt and hindered, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſcend actually, ſo may it be in this caſe; and therefore, before a man can be fitted for Sufferings, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, there muſt to this habitual be ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an <hi>actual readineſs,</hi> which is nothing elſe but the rouzing of Grace out of the ſleepy and dull ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and awakening it to its work in a time of need: as the Lyon is ſaid to laſh himſelf with his Tail, to rouze up his Courage before he fight. The former is a <hi>remote</hi> power; the latter a <hi>proxim</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate power. I muſt handle the former in this Chapter, and you are to know, that <hi>it conſiſteth in a found and reall work of Grace or Converſion wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:110122:23"/>the ſoul;</hi> without which I ſhall make it evidently appear to you, that no man can be fit or ready to ſuffer as a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>What ever ſtock of natural Courage, moral Principles, or common Gifts of the Spirit be lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any mans Breaſt, yet all this (without ſpecial grace) can never fit him to ſuffer for Chriſt. And had not this Work been really and ſoundly wrought upon the heart of this bleſſed man, as indeed it was, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.3, 4, 5. he had quickly fainted under his Sufferings; and ſo will every ſoul ſooner or later do, that ſuffers not upon the ſame Principles he did.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For firſt, No man can ſuffer for Chriſt, until he be able to deny himſelf, See <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial goes in order of Nature before Sufferings. Beloved, In a Suffering hour the Intereſts of Chriſt and Self meet like two men upon a narrow Bridge; one muſt of neceſſity go back, or the other cannot paſs on: If you cannot now deny <hi>Self,</hi> you muſt deny <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Yoke and Dominion of Self muſt be <hi>coſt off,</hi> or elſe Chriſts Yoke and Burden cannot be taken on.</p>
               <p>It is confeſt that Self may not onely <hi>conſiſt</hi> with, but be a <hi>motive</hi> to ſome kind of Sufferings: Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Applauſe may carry a man far this way; Pride is a <hi>Salamander</hi> that it ſeems can live in the flames of Martyrdome, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. but to be a <hi>Servant</hi> to Self, and a true <hi>Sufferer</hi> for Chriſt are incompatible. Self may make you the <hi>Devil</hi>'s <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> but Grace onely can make you <hi>Chriſts Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</hi> So that let a man be ſeemingly carried for a while with never ſo high a Tide of Zeal for Chriſt, yet if Self be the Spring that feeds it, thoſe ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends like ſo many little <hi>Ditches</hi> joyned to the Banks of a River, ſhall ſuck and draw away the Water
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:110122:23"/>into themſelves, that the lofty Stream will ſink and come to nothing ere it have ran far: So then of neceſſity Self muſt be dethroned in the hearts of Chriſts ſuffering Servants.</p>
               <p>But now it is real Grace onely that depoſes Self, and ſubjects its Intereſts to Chriſts; for Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is nothing elſe but <hi>the dethroneing of exalted ſnf, and the ſetting up of Chriſts Intereſt above it in the Soul.</hi> This is it that alters the property of all a man hath, and ſuperſcribes them with a new Title, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 23.18. Zech. 14.20, 21. Thenceforth a man looks at himſelf as none of his own, but paſt into anothers right, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. and that he muſt neither <hi>live,</hi> nor <hi>act ultimately</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20. He is no more as a <hi>Proprietor,</hi> but a <hi>Steward</hi> of all he hath, and ſo holds out upon theſe terms to lay it out or lay it down as may beſt ſerve his Maſters ends and glory.</p>
               <p>All that he is or hath, is by Grace ſubordinated to Chriſt; and if once; <hi>ſubordinated,</hi> then no more <hi>oppoſed</hi> to him <hi>ſubordinata non pugnant.</hi> This is it that makes him ſay, I care not what becomes of me or mine, ſo Chriſt may be glorified. <hi>Let Chriſt be m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d in my body, whether it be by life, or by death,</hi> Phil. 1.20.</p>
               <p>By Converſion Chriſt enters the ſoul,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.</note> as an Army doth an Enemies Garriſon by Storm, and when he is poſſeſt of it by Grace, he preſently divides the whole ſpoil of Self betwixt himſelf and his Church. This is the firſt thing that evinces the neceſſity of a Work of Grace to prepare the heart for Sufferings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And then in the next place, It is as evident that a man can never be fit to ſuffer hard Things for Chriſt, until his Spirit be enlarged, raiſed, and ennobled, ſo that he be able to deſpiſe Dangers,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110122:24"/>and look Difficulties in the face. That low and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Spirit muſt be removed, and a <hi>publick</hi> Spirit muſt poſſeſs him. If a man be of a feeble and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Spirit, every petty Danger will daunt and ſink him; Delicacy and Tenderneſs is as unſuitable to a Chriſtian as to a Souldier, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3. They that mean to enter into the Kingdome of God, muſt reſolve to make their way through that brake of Troubles betwixt them and it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. They that will be crowned with Victory, muſt ſtand to it, and play the men, as that word imports, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. Look over all the Sacred and Humane Hiſtories, and ſee if you can find a man that ever honoured Chriſt by Suffering, that was not of a raiſed and noble Spirit, and in ſome meaſure able to contemn both the allurements and threats of men. So thoſe three noble Jews, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, 17. ſo <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 11.27. and ſo our Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. and the ſame heroick and brave Spirit was found in the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages amongſt the Witneſſes of Chriſt. When <hi>Valence</hi> the <hi>Empercur</hi> endeavoured to draw <hi>Baſil</hi> from the Faith by Offers of Preferment, <hi>Offer theſe things</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to Children;</hi> when he threatned him with torments, <hi>Threaten theſe things</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to your Purple Gallauts that live delicately.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Baſil</hi> relating the Story of the fourty Martyrs, ſaith, That when great Honours and Preferments were offered them to draw them from Chriſt, their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, <hi>Why offer you theſe ſmall things of the world to us (O Emperour) when you know the whole world is contemned by us!</hi> So <hi>Luther,</hi> Money could not tempt him, nor the fear of man daunt him. <hi>Let me</hi> (ſaid he in his Letter to <hi>Staupicius) be accounted proud, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, a murtherer, guilty of all vices, rather then of wicked ſilence and cowardize in the Cauſe of Chriſt.</hi> Thus you ſee to to what an height and holy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110122:24"/>the Spirits of ſuffering Saints in all Ages have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>een raiſed.</p>
               <p>But now it is Grace that thus raiſes the Spirits of men above all the ſmiles and honours, frowns and fears of men: and no other principle but Grace can do it. There is indeed a <hi>natural ſtoutneſs</hi> and generoſity in ſome, which may carry them far, as it's ſaid of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that when any great danger approached him, his courage would riſe, and he would ſay, <hi>Jam periculum par animo</hi> Alexandri, here is a danger fit for <hi>Alexander</hi> to encounter; ſo <hi>Pompey</hi> when diſſwaded from a dangerous Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, anſwered, <hi>Neceſſe eſt ut eam, non ut vivam, It's neceſſary that I go, not that I live.</hi> But this being fed onely by a natural Spring, can carry a man no higher then Nature, and will flag at laſt. If ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and the obſervation of the world ſupply it not, it quickly ebbs and fails.</p>
               <p>But as Grace raiſes men much higher, ſo it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it even when there is nothing to encourage without; when forſaken of all Creatures, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſupports, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. and this it doth three wayes: (1) By guiding him that hath a view of far greater things, which ſhrinks up all temporary things, and makes them appear but trifles and ſmall matters, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. By Grace a man riſes with Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. It ſets him upon his high places, and thence he looks down upon things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as very poor and inconſiderable. The great Cities of <hi>Campania</hi> ſeem but little ſpots to them that ſtand on the top of the <hi>Alps.</hi> (2) By teaching him to value and meaſure all things by another Rule, then he was wont to do. He did once mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure life, liberty, riches, honours, by ſenſe and time; and then they ſeemed great things, and it was hard to deny them; Or thus to ſlight them; but now he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:110122:25"/>values and meaſures all by Faith and Eternity; and eſteems nothing great and excellent, but what hath a reference to the Glory of God, and an influence into Eternity. (3) Grace raiſes and ennobles the Spirit thus, becauſe it is the Divine nature; 'tis the Spirit of Chriſt infuſed into a poor Worm, which makes a ſtrange alteration on him, transforms him into another manner of perſon; as much difference betwixt hir Spirit now, and what it was, as betwixt the Spirit of a <hi>Child,</hi> that is filled with ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and taken up with toyes; and of a grave <hi>States-man,</hi> that is daily imployed about the grand affairs of a Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man can never ſuffer as a Chriſtian, till his will be ſubjected to the Will of God. He that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers <hi>involuntarily,</hi> and out of neceſſity, not out of choice, ſhall neither have <hi>acceptance</hi> nor <hi>reward</hi> from God. Of neceſſity the will muſt be ſubjected; a man can never ſay, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> till he can firſt ſay, <hi>Not my will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is Grace onely that thus conquers and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the will of man to Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. This is it that exalts Gods Authority in the Soul, and makes the heart to ſtoop and tremble at his Commands. 'Tis this which makes our will to write its <hi>fiat</hi> at the foot of every Command, and its <hi>placet</hi> under every Order it receives from God. No ſooner was Grace entred into the ſoul of <hi>Paul,</hi> but preſently he cries out, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts 9.6. The Will is to the Soul what the Wheels are to the Chariot; and Grace to is the Will what Oyl is to thoſe Wheels. When we receive the Spirit of Grace, we are ſaid to <hi>receive an Unction from the holy One,</hi> 1 John 2.20. and then the Soul is made as the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab,</hi> Cant. 6.12. <hi>Non tardat uncta rota,</hi> it runs freely after the Lord, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110122:25"/>chearfully addreſſeth it ſelf to every Service.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A man can never ſuffer as a Chriſtian, untill his heart be compoſed, fixed, and determined to follow the Lord through all Hazards and Difficulties. As long as a man is heſitating and unreſolved what to do, whether to go forward, or turn back again to the proſperous World, when a man is at ſuch a <hi>pauſe</hi> and ſtand in his way, he is very unfit for Sufferings. All ſuch Diviſions do both <hi>we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ken</hi> the Soul, and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the Temptation: The Devils work is more then half done to his hands in ſuch a Soul; and he is now as unfit to endure hardſhip for Chriſt, as a Ship is to ride out a Storm, that hath neither Cable, Anchor, nor Ballaſt to hold and ſettle it; but lies at the mercy of every Wave, <hi>James</hi> 1.8. <hi>The double-minded man is unſtable in all his wayes.</hi> But it's Grace and nothing beſides it, that brings the heart to a fixed reſolution and ſettlement to follow the Lord. 'Tis Grace that <hi>eſtabliſhes, the heart, He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 13.9. and unites it to fear the Name of God, <hi>Pſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l.</hi> 86.11. This gathers all the Streams into one Channel, and then it runs with much ſtrength, and ſweeps away all obſtacles before it. So that look as it is with a wicked man that hath ſold himſelf to do wickedly, if he be ſet upon any one deſign of ſin, he pours out his whole heart and ſtrength in the proſecution of that Deſign; which is the ground of that ſaying, <hi>Liberet me Deus ab homine unius tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum negetii,</hi> Let God deliver me from a man of one onely Deſign. He will do it to purpoſe: So is it alſo in Grace; If the heart be compoſed, fixed, and fully reſolved for God, nothing ſhall then ſtand before him. And herein lies much of a Chriſtians habitual fitneſs and ability to ſuffer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The neceſſity of Saving-Grace in all Sufferers for Chriſt will farther appear from this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110122:26"/>That he who will run all hazards for Chriſt, had need of a continual ſupply of ſtrength and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment from time to time. He muſt not depend on any thing that is failable: For what ſhall he do then, when that ſtock is ſpent, and he hath no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion left to live upon? Now all natural qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yea all the common gifts of the Spirit are failable and ſhort-lived things; they are like a ſweet Flower in the boſome, that is an ornament for a little while, but withers preſently: Or like a Pond or Brook occaſioned by a great fall of Rain, which quickly ſinks and dries up, becauſe it is not fed by Springs in the bottome, as other Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters are: and hence it is they cannot continue and hold out when Sufferings come, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.21. becauſe there is no Root to nouriſh and ſupport. The Hypocrite will not alwayes call upon God, <hi>Job</hi> 27.10. Though they may keep company with Chriſt a few miles in this dirty way, yet they muſt turn back at laſt and ſhake hands eternally with him, <hi>John</hi> 6.66. Theſe <hi>Commets</hi> may ſeem to ſhine for a time among the Stars, but when that earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter is ſpent, they muſt fall and loſe their glory.</p>
               <p>But now, Grace is an everlaſting principle, it hath Springs in the bottome that never fail. <hi>It ſhall be in him</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>a Well of water ſpringing up into eternal life,</hi> John 4.14. The Spirit of God ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it from time to time as need requires. It hath, daily incomes from Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Col.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Munimur quatenus unimur.</note> 1.11. So that it is our union with Chriſt the Fountain by Grace, that is the true ground of our conſtancy and long-ſuffering.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And then laſtly. It will appear by this alſo, that there is an abſolute neceſſity of a real change by Grace on all that will ſuffer for Chriſt; becauſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110122:26"/>although we may <hi>engage</hi> our ſelves in ſufferings without it, yet we can never <hi>manage</hi> our ſufferings like Chriſtians without it. They will neither be honourable, or acceptable to God, nor yet benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and comfortable to our ſelves or others, except they be performed from this principle of Grace: For upon what principle ſoever beſide this, any man is acted in Religion, it will either cauſe him to decline Sufferings for Chriſt: or if he be engaged in them, yet he will little credit Religion by his Sufferings. They will either be ſpoiled by an ill management, or his own pride will devour the praiſe and glory of them. I do not deny, but a man that's graceleſs, may ſuffer many hard things upon the account of his profeſſion, and ſuffer them all in vain, as theſe Scriptures manifeſt. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.4. and although you find many ſweet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to thoſe that ſuffer for Chriſt, yet you muſt conſider, that thoſe pure and ſpiritual Ends and Motives, by which men ought to be acted in their ſufferings, are always ſuppoſed and implyed in all thoſe Promiſes that are made to the external action. And ſometimes it is expreſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.16. to ſuffer [as a Chriſtian] is to ſuffer from pure Chriſtian Principles, and in a Chriſtian manner, with <hi>Meekneſs, Patience, Self-denial,</hi> &amp;c. and this onely Grace can enable you to do: So that by all this I ſuppoſe what I have undertaken in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, <hi>viz.</hi> to evince the neceſſity of a Work of Grace to paſs upon you, before Sufferings for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion come, is by all this performed to ſatisfaction.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HAving in the former Chapter plainly evinced the neceſſity of ſaving Grace, to fit a man for Sufferings; it will be expected now, that ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be given you of the nature of this Work, and how it advantages a man for the diſcharge of the hardeſt ſervices in Religion: Both which I ſhall open in this Chapter, by a diſtinct Explication of the parts of this deſcription of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This work of Grace,
<note place="margin">What ſaving Grace is.</note> of which I am here to ſpeak, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the reall change of the whole Man, by the Spirit of God, whereby he is prepared for every good work:</hi> In which brief Deſcription, I ſhall open theſe four things to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is a Change; this is palpably evident, both from Scripture and Experience. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Old things are paſt away, behold, all things are become new;</hi> and it is ſo ſenſible a Change, that it's called a <hi>turning from darkneſs to light,</hi> Act. 26.18. and a new Creature formed and brought forth. But to be a little more diſtinct and particular, there are ſeveral other Changes that paſs upon men, which muſt not be miſtaken for this: and therefore, (1.) It is not a meer change of the Judgment from Errour to Truth, from Paganiſme to Chriſtianity. Such a Change <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had, yet ſtill remained in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and faſt bound in the Bonds of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110122:27"/>Iniquity, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.23. (2.) Nor onely of a mans practice, from <hi>Prophaneſs</hi> to <hi>Civility;</hi> this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among ſuch as live under the Light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which breaking into mens Conſciences, thwarts their Luſts, and over-awes them with the fears of Hell: Which is no more then what the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. (3.) Nor is it a change from meer <hi>Morality,</hi> to meer <hi>Formality</hi> in Religion. Thus <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are changed, by the common gifts of the Spirit, illuminating their Minds, and ſlightly touching their Affections, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. (4.) Nor is it ſuch a Change as Juſtification makes, which is relative, and onely alters the ſtate and condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. (5.) Laſtly, it is not a change of the Eſſence of a Man; he remains eſſentially the ſame perſon ſtill.</p>
               <p>But this Change conſiſts in the infuſion of New Habits of Grace, into the old Faculties; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly depoſe ſinne from its dominion over the Soul, and deliver up the Soul into the Hands and Government of Chriſt, ſo that it lives no more to it ſelf, but to Chriſt. This is that Change whereof we ſpeak: And this Change (2) I aſſert to be <hi>reall,</hi> no phanſie, nor deluſion; not a groundleſs conceit, but it is really exiſtent, <hi>extra mentem,</hi> whether you conceit it or not. Indeed, the blind World would perſwade us it is <hi>ſuppoſititious,</hi> and <hi>phantaſtick;</hi> and that there is no ſuch reall difference betwixt one man and another, as we affirm Grace makes. And hence it is, that whoever profeſſeth it, is preſently branded for a <hi>Phanatique;</hi> and that Scripture, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 56.5. <hi>Stand by thy ſelf, I am holier then thou,</hi> &amp;c. clapt in their Teeth, in their abſurd and perverſe ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall briefly offer theſe ſeven things to your conſideration, which will abundantly evince the

                  </gap> Mouthes of ignorant men, and ſilence thoſe Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Surmiſes, which at any time Sathan may inject into the hearts of Gods own people touching this matter. And <hi>firſt,</hi> let it be conſidered, that the Spirit of God hath repreſented to us this Work of Grace, under ſuch Names and Notions in Scripture, as if they had been choſen purpoſely to obviate this Calumny. It's called a <hi>Creature, Gal.</hi> 6.15. a <hi>Man,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. a <hi>New Birth, Joh.</hi> 3.3. Chriſt formed in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. all which expreſs its real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that it is not a conceited thing. (2.) It appears to be reall by the marvellous effects it hath upon a man, turning him both in Judgment, Will, Affections, and Practice, quite counter to what he was before. This is evident, in that famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 1.23. which is abundantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted and ſealed, by the conſtant experience of all gracious Souls, that are Witneſſes of the Truth hereof. (3.) A Divine and Almighty Power goes forth to produce and work it: and hence Faith is ſaid to be of the operation of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. Yea, that the ſame Power which raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead, goes to the production of it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19, 20. And if ſo, how much leſs then Blaſphemy is it, to call it a Conceit or Phanſie? Doth God ſet on work his infinite Power to beget a Phanſie, or raiſe an imagination? (4.) Conceits and Whimſies abound moſt in men of weak Reaſon: Children, and ſuch as are crackt in their Underſtandings have moſt of them: ſtrength of Reaſon baniſhes them, as the Sun doth Miſts and Vapours: But now the more rational any gracious perſon is, by ſo much the more he is fixed, ſetled, and ſatisfied in the Grounds of Religion: Yea, there is the higheſt and pureſt Reaſon in Religion: and when this Change is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110122:28"/>wrought upon men, it's carryed on in a rational way, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.9. The Spirit overpours the Underſtanding with clear Demonſtrations, and ſilences all Objections, Pleas, and Pretences, to the contrary. (5) It's a real thing, and gracious Souls know it to be ſo; elſe ſo many Thouſands of the Saints would never have ſuffered ſo many cruel Torments and Miſeries, rather then forſake a fancy, and ſo ſave all. They have been ſo well ſatisfied of the reality of that which the World calls a Phanſie, that they have choſen rather to embrace the Stake, than deny it. The conſtancy of Chriſtians, in clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to Religion, was common to a <hi>Proverb</hi> among the <hi>Heathen;</hi> who when they would expreſs the greateſt difficulty, would ſay, <hi>You may as ſoon turn a Chriſtian from Chriſt as do it.</hi> Surely no wiſe man would ſacrifice his Liberty, Eſtate, Life, and all that is dear, for a Conceit. (6) It's reality ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in its uniformity in all thoſe on whom it is wrought: <hi>They have all obtained like precious Faith,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1. <hi>They are all changed into the ſame Image,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. Three Thouſand Perſons affected in one and the ſame manner at one Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. Could one and the ſame Conceit poſſeſs them all together? Take two Chriſtians that live a Thouſand miles diſtant from each other, that never heard of one another, let theſe Perſons be examined, and their Reports compared, and ſee if they do not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially agree; and whether as Face anſwers Face in Water, ſo their Experiences do not anſwer one to the other? which could never be, if it were a groundleſs Conceit. (7) And laſtly, it's mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, it is a reality, and puts a real difference betwixt one and another; becauſe God carryes himſelf ſo differently towards them, after their Converſion; now he ſmiles, before he frowned; now they are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110122:29"/>under the Promiſes, before they were under the Threats and Curſes; and what a vaſt difference will he put betwixt the one and other in that great Day? See <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Surely, if theſe nominal Chriſtians did but differ in Conceit, not really from others, the Righteous Judge of all the Earth would not paſs ſuch a different Judgment and Doom upon them.</p>
               <p>By all this you evidently ſee, that Grace is a reall Change, and not a conceited one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſay that this reall Change paſſes upon the whole Man: he is changed in <hi>Soul, Body,</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;</hi> all things are become new. (1) This Change appears in his Soul: For by it, (1) his Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is ſtrongly altered, and receives things in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way than formerly. It did look at Chriſt and things Eternal, as uncertain and light matters: The things that are ſeen and preſent, did moſtly affect, and appeared great and excellent: It admired Riches and Honours, while Chriſt and Glory were over-looked and deſpiſed. But now, all theſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals are eſteemed Dung, Droſs, Vanity, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. and Jeſus Chriſt is now eſteemed <hi>the wiſdom and the power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.23, 24. It did look on the Saints as deſpicable perſons, but now as the <hi>excellent of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 16.3. Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Duty was once eſteemed a needleſs thing, but now the onely thing deſireable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.14. Oh, ſaith the renewed Soul, <hi>Where were mine Eyes, that I could ſee no more excellency in Chriſt, his wayes, and people!</hi> (2) It ſtops not there (as it doth in Hypocrites) but paſſes on further, and reduces the Will; that ſtrong Hold is taken, and delivered up to Chriſt. It did rebel againſt God, and could not be ſubject, but now it ſubmits, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> In the day of Chriſts power, he preſents himſelf in all his drawing glory and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:110122:29"/>before the Will, and cryes to that ſtubborn Faculty, <hi>Open to me, open to me;</hi> with which Word there goes forth an opening and ſubduing Power, which the Will no ſooner feels, but it ſpontaneouſly moves towards him, and ſaith, <hi>Stand open ye everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gates, that the King of Glory may come in.</hi> Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth it votes for God, ſubſcribes and ſubmits to his Will, as its onely Rule and Law; and indeed, it becomes the principal Seat where Grace makes its Reſidence; and where, for the moſt part, it is more viſible then in any other Faculty. For after a man hath ſearched for it in all other Faculties, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern it, yet here he ordinarily finds it; to will is preſent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. (3) The Will being thus gained to Chriſt, Love comes in of courſe; it feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of Grace alſo, preſently changeth its Object: It ſeizeth not ſo greedily on Earthly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as before, but is ſtrangely cooled and deadned to them, by the appearance of a far greater Glory in Jeſus Chriſt; which hath ſo captivated the Soul, and ſtrongly attracted this Affection, that its now become very remiſs in all its actings towards them: and often, (eſpecially at firſt) it is ſo weaned from all things on Earth, that the Temptation ſeems to lye on the other Extream, even in too great neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of our lawful Employments and Comforts. Now Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. his Ordinances, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. and his Saints, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Delights, and ſweeteſt Companions; he could ſit from Morning to Night, to hear Diſcourſes of Chriſt his beloved, and could live and die in the company of his people, whoſe company is now moſt delightful and ſweet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.63. (4) The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are altered, they pant no more after the Duſt of the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. but pant for God, as the <hi>Hart for the Brooks of water, Pſal.</hi> 42.1. Yea, ſo big
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110122:30"/>is the Soul with them, that it's ſometimes ready to faint, yea to break with the longing it hath after him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20. (5) The Thoughts are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.113. and the Thoughts of God are now moſt precious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.47. muſing, when alone, of him; and, in its Solitudes, the Soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains it ſelf with a delightful Feaſt, which its Thoughts of God bring in to refreſh it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5, 6. (6) The Deſigns and Projects of the Soul are changed; all are now ſwallowed up in one grand Deſign, even to approve himſelf to God, and be accepted of him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. and if he fail not there, it will not much trouble him, if all his other Deſigns ſhould be daſhed.</p>
               <p>It were eaſie to inſtance in the reſt of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſhew how Grace ſpreads and diffuſes it ſelf into them all, as Light in the Air, or Leaven in the Lump; but this may ſuffice, to ſhew how it paſſes upon the whole Soul, and enters the ſeveral Faculties and Affections thereof.</p>
               <p>And the Soul being thus poſſeſt for God, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with all its Members, is conſequently reſigned up to him alſo: For the Will hath the <hi>Empire</hi> of the Members of the Body, as well as of the Paſſions and Affections of the Soul. Theſe are not any more delivered up to execute the Luſts of Satan, but are yielded up to God for his ends and uſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. And thus you have the third thing in the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made out alſo, that it is an univerſal, as well as a reall Change. But then,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, You muſt know that by this change God prepares a man for choice and excellent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; and this indeed is the main thing deſigned in this Capter, and is the reſult and iſſue of all that hath hitherto been ſaid about this work of Grace.</p>
               <p>Beloved, can you imagine that God would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110122:30"/>his infinite and glorious Power, to produce his new Creature in ſuch an excellent nature, it being the Maſterpiece of all his Works of wonder wrought upon man, and not aim at ſome ſingular uſe and excellent end? Every wiſe Agent deſigns ſome end; and what God aims at he hath told us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.21. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. And accordingly he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects ſingular things from ſuch perſons, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.47. If God had not aimed at ſome new ſervice, he need not have made a new Creature: the old Creature was fit enough for the old uſe and ſervice it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in. But God hath ſome choice ſervice to be done, wherein he will be glorified. He will have his Name glorified even in this world by the active and paſſive obedience of his people. But this being far above all the power of Nature, God therefore brings them forth in a new and heavenly nature, endowed with rare ſupernatural and divine quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by which it is fitted and excellently prepared for any ſervice of God by doing or by ſuffering, which before he had no fitneſs or ability for.</p>
               <p>The very make and conſtitution of this new Creature ſpeaks its uſe and end: As now, if a man look upon a Sword or Knife (ſuppoſing he had never ſeen either before) yet I ſay by viewing the ſhape and properties of it, he will ſay, This was made to cut. Even ſo here, This new Creature was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome glorious and ſingular ſervice for God, to which it is exceedingly advantaged, whether God put you upon doing or ſuffering. If you ask wherein this advantage of the new Creature to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God either way lies; I anſwer, It principally conſiſts in its <hi>heavenly inclination,</hi> or natural <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> to God. This is its great advantage. For by vertue of this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If God call a man to any duty, there is a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110122:31"/>
                  <hi>Principle</hi> with in cloſing with the <hi>Command</hi> without, and moving the ſoul freely &amp; ſpontaneouſly to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8. If God ſay, <hi>Seek my face,</hi> ſuch an heart ecchoes to the call, <hi>Thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> And this is it which is call'd, <hi>The writing of Gods Law in the heart,</hi> Jer. 31.33. and muſt needs be a mighty advantage; for now its work is its delight and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11. The command to ſuch a Soul is not grievous, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. And by this it's kept from tiring in duty, and being weary of its work; as you ſee what pains Children can take at play, how they will run and ſweat, and endure knocks and falls, and take no notice of it; put them upon any manual labour, and they cannot endure half ſo much. When our work is our delight, we never faint nor tire at it. This inclination to God is to the Soul as wings to a Bird, or ſails to a Ship. This carries the Soul eaſily through every duty. O there is a vaſt difference betwixt a man that <hi>works for wages,</hi> and one whoſe <hi>work is wages</hi> to him. And here you may at once ſee wherein the principal difference betwixt the Hypocrite and the real Chriſtian lies in the performance of duty; and alſo have a true account of the reaſon why one perſeveres in his work to the end, when the other flags. Why, here is the true account of both; The one is moved to duty from a natural inclination to it, the other is forced upon it by ſome external motives: For the Hypocrite takes not delight in the ſpiritual and inward part of duty, but is ſecretly weary of it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. onely his ambition and ſelf-ends put him upon it as a task. But now the upright heart goes to God as his joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.4. and ſaith, <hi>It is good for me to draw nigh to God,</hi> Pſal. 73. <hi>ult.</hi> When the Sabbath comes, <hi>(that Golden Spot of the Week)</hi> oh how he longs to <hi>ſee the beauty of the Lord</hi> in his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110122:31"/>Ordinances! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. and when engaged in the worſhip of God, he cannot ſatisfie himſelf in <hi>bodily ſervice,</hi> or to ſerve God <hi>in the oldneſs of the letter.</hi> He knoweth that <hi>this perſwaſion cometh not of him that called him,</hi> Gal. 5.7, 8. He labours to engage his heart to approach to God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. And hence thoſe mountings of heart, and violent ſallies of the deſires heaven-ward. And thus you ſee one rare advantage to glorifie God actively, flowing from the inclination of this new Creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then ſecondly; Hence in like manner hath the Soul as great an advantage for ſufferings: For this new Creature having ſuch a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to God, will enable the ſoul in which it is, to break its way to God through all the interpoſing obſtacles and diſcouragements. What are perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what are reproaches, what are the fears and frowns of enemies, but ſo many blocks thrown in the Souls way to keep it from God and Duty? And indeed where this principle of Grace is wanting, they prove inacceſſible Mountains. Graceleſs hearts are ſtalled and quite diſcouraged by them; but now this tendency of the Soul to God enables the Chriſtian to break his way through all. You may ſay of him in ſuch a caſe, as the Hiſtorian doth of <hi>Hannibal</hi> (who forced a way over the <hi>Alps</hi> with Fire and Vinegar) either he will find a way, or make a way. <hi>Shall Sword or Famine, or any other Creature ſeparate me from Chriſt?</hi> ſaith an upright Soul. No, no, it will through all to him, and that from this tendency of his new Nature. You ſee in Nature, every thing hath a tendency to its center; Fire will up, do what you can to ſuppreſs it; Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will to the Sea, if it meet with Dams, yea Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in its way; if it cannot bear them down, it will creep about ſome other way, and wind and

Though God can quickly remove the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and doubts of a ſoul; yet ordinarily the Saints find it a very hard and difficult thing to obtain and preſerve the evidences of their Graces. Such is the darkneſs, deadneſs, and deceitfulneſs of the heart, ſo much unevenneſs and inconſtancy in their practice, ſo many counterfeits of Grace, and ſo many wiles and devices of Satan to rob them of their peace, that few (in compariſon) live in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and quiet fruition of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Notwithſtanding all theſe things which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the difficulty, yet God hath afforded his people a ſure Light, and ſufficient means in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent uſe and improvement whereof they may attain a certainty of the work of Grace in them. And there is a threefold Light by which it may moſt clearly and infallibly be diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Scripture Light, which is able to diſcover the ſecrets of a mans heart to him; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compared to the <hi>Anatomizers</hi> Knife, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The innate Light of Grace it ſelf; or if you will the Light of Experience, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. It hath ſome properties and operations which are as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110122:33"/>neceſſary, and inſeparable, as heat is to the fire, and may be ſenſibly felt and perceived by the Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Light of the Spirit, ſuperadded to both the former, which is ſometimes called its <hi>Earneſt,</hi> ſometimes its <hi>Seal.</hi> The Spirit doth both <hi>plant</hi> the <hi>habits, excite</hi> and draw forth the <hi>acts,</hi> and alſo <hi>ſhine</hi> upon his own work that the Soul may ſee it; and that ſometimes with ſuch a degree of Light, as onely begets peace, and quiets the heart, though it do not fully conquer all the doubts of it. And at other times the heart is irradiated with ſo clear a Beam of Light, that it's able to draw forth the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Concluſion, and ſay, Now I know the things that are freely given me of God. I believe and am ſure.</p>
               <p>And ſo much briefly for the opening of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this evidence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew you the neceſſity of it to a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saint, in order to the right management of a ſuffering condition.</p>
               <p>And this will appear by the conſideration of five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Dem, </seg>1</label> You will readily grant that the Chriſtians love to God hath a mighty influence into all his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for God. This Grace of <hi>love</hi> enables him victoriouſly to break through all difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements. <hi>The Flood's cannot drown it, nor the Waters quench it,</hi> Cant. 8.6, 7. It facilitates the greateſt hardſhips, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. And whatever a man ſuffer, if it be not from this principle, it is neither acceptable to God, nor available to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3.</p>
               <p>But now nothing more inflames and quickens the Chriſtians love to God, then the knowledge of his intereſt in him, and the ſenſible perception and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:110122:34"/>taſte of his love to the Soul. Our love to God is but a reflection of his own love: And the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the ſtroke of the direct Beam is, the more is the reflex Beam alſo. Never doth that <hi>flame of Jah</hi> burn with a more vehement heat, then when the Soul hath the moſt clear manifeſtations of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt and his benefits, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47.</p>
               <p>It muſt needs be of ſingular uſe to a ſuffering Saint,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Dem. </seg>2</label> becauſe it takes out the ſinking weight of affliction. That which ſinks and breaks the Spirit, is the conjunction and meeting of inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles together; then if the Lord do not ſtrangely and extraordinarily ſupport the Soul, it's wrackt and overwhelmed as the Ship in which <hi>Paul</hi> ſailed was, when it fell into a place where two Seas met, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.41. Oh how tempeſtuous a Sea doth that Soul ſail in, that hath fightings <hi>without,</hi> and fears <hi>within!</hi> How muſt that poor Chriſtians heart trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meditate terrour, that when he retires from troubles without for ſome comfort and ſupport within, ſhall find a ſad <hi>addition</hi> to his troubles from whence he expected relief againſt them! Hence it was that <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſo earneſtly deprecates ſuch a miſery, <hi>Be not thou a terrour to me, thou art my hope in the day of evil,</hi> Jer. 17.17. This is prevented by this means: If a man have a clear breaſt, and all be quiet within, he is like one that hath a good Roof over his head when the Storm falls. <hi>We glory in tribulation, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts,</hi> Rom. 5.3, 5.</p>
               <p>It is a fountain of joy and comfort in the darkeſt and ſaddeſt hour.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Dem. </seg>3</label> Hence the glorious triumphs of Saints in their afflictions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. and in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians joy in the Lord, lies much of his ſtrength for ſufferings, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.10. If once the Spirit droop and ſink, the man is in a bad caſe to ſuffer: holy joy, it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110122:34"/>is the Oyl that makes the Chariot-wheels of the Soul free to follow the Lord; <hi>Non tardat uncta rota.</hi> To ſuffer with joyfullneſs for Chriſt is a qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Gods Eye is much upon in his ſuffering Servants, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. How did theſe famous Worthies magnifie Chriſt, and glorifie Religion by the holy triumphs of their faith and joy under tribulation! One kiſs'd the <hi>Apparator</hi> that brought him news of his Condemnation, and was like a man tranſported with an exceſs of joy. Another upon the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Sentence, kneels down, and with hands and eyes lifted up, ſolemnly bleſſes God for ſuch a day as that. Oh how is Chriſt magnified by this! And this can not be untill intereſt be cleared. It's true the <hi>faith of recumbency</hi> gives the Soul a ſecret ſupport, and enables the Chriſtian to <hi>live;</hi> but the <hi>faith of evidence</hi> keeps him <hi>lively,</hi> and prevents all thoſe uncomfortable and uncomely ſinkings and deſpondencies of ſpirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 17. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot but be of ſingular uſe to a ſoul at ſuch a time.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Dem. </seg>4</label> It is of ſpecial uſe to a Chriſtian under ſufferings, inaſmuch as it enables him to repell the temptations that attend upon ſufferings. Nothing ſets a keener edge upon his indignation againſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy compliances, then this. Indeed a poor clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and dubious Chriſtian will be apt to catch at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, though upon terms diſhonourable to Chriſt: but he that is clear in point of intereſt, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors compoſitions and capitulations upon unworthy terms and conditions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. He that ſees the gain and reward of ſuffering, will think he is offered to his loſs, when life and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance are ſet before him upon ſuch hard terms as ſin is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:110122:35"/>And thus you ſee what influence it hath into a ſuffering condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the next place I promiſed to preſcribe ſome Rules for the attaining of this Evidence, and the diſpelling of thoſe Doubts by which it is uſually clouded in the ſouls of Believers. And oh that by the faithfull uſe of them you may attain it againſt a ſuffering day come upon you.</p>
               <p>And the firſt Rule I ſhall give you is this.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>1</label> Make it your buſineſs to improve Grace more; for the more <hi>vigorous</hi> it is, the more <hi>evidential</hi> it muſt needs be, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Oh how much time have many Chriſtians ſpent in enquiring after the loweſt ſigns of ſincerity, and what may conſiſt with Grace; which had they ſpent in the diligent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the means of Grace for the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it, they would have found it a ſhorter cut to peace and comfort by much.</p>
               <p>Miſtake not the Rule by which you are to trie your ſelves,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>2</label> leaſt you gain a falſe judgement upon your ſelves. Some are apt to make thoſe things ſigns of Grace, which are not; and when the falſeneſs of them is detected, how is that poor Soul plunged into doubts and fears, that leaned upon them. As now, If a man ſhould conclude his ſincerity from his diligence in attending on the Word preached; this is but a <hi>Paralogiſm</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls it) <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22. by which a man deceiveth his own Soul: For that which is a note or mark, muſt be proper to the thing notified, and not common to any thing elſe. There are divers ſorts of <hi>marks;</hi> ſome are <hi>excluſive,</hi> the principal uſe of which is to convince bold Pretenders, and diſcover Hypocrites. Such is that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9. It is a moſt certain ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> where theſe are, there is no Grace; but yet it will not follow on the contrary, that where theſe are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:110122:35"/>not, there is Grace. See <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. Others are <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eluſive,</hi> the uſe of which is not ſo much for try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truth; and the ſtrength and degrees of Grace. As now when Faith is deſcribed by the <hi>radiancy</hi> of it, or by ſome of its heroick acts and promiſes made to ſome raiſed degrees and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, as that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take is eaſily made. Beſides theſe, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt theſe, are another ſort of marks, which are called <hi>poſitive</hi> marks; and theſe agreeing to the loweſt degree of Grace, are for the trial of the truth and ſincerity of it. Such are theſe, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 4.13. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3. Be ſure to try by a proper mark.</p>
               <p>Take heed of ſuch ſins as violate and waſte the Conſcience: For theſe will quickly raiſe a miſt,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>3</label> and involve the Soul in clouds and darkneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such are ſins againſt Light, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Labour to ſhun thoſe common miſtakes that Chriſtians make in judging of their ſtate;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>4</label> amongſt which I ſhall ſelect theſe five as principal ones.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Call not your condition into queſtion upon every failing, and involuntary lapſe into ſin. <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities prevail againſt me: as for our tranſgreſſions, thou ſhalt purge them away,</hi> Pſal. 65.3. In ſhort, thou needeſt not call thy condition into queſtion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided thou find thy Spirit working as <hi>Paul</hi>'s did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſurpriſals of temptation: <hi>viz</hi> If (1) thou do approve of, and delight in the Law, though thou fall ſhort of it in thy practice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12, 14. (2) If thy failings be involuntary, and againſt the reſolution and bent of thy Soul, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.18, 19. (3) If it be the load and burden of thy Soul, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. (4) If the thoughts of deliverance comfort thee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:110122:36"/>2. Queſtion not the truth of thy Grace, becauſe it was not wrought in the ſame way and manner in thee, as in others: For there is great variety, as to the circumſtances of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> betwixt the Spirits operations upon one, and another. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Hiſtory of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Converſion with that of the <hi>Jaylor, Zacheus,</hi> or <hi>Lydia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conclude not that you have no grace, becauſe you feel not thoſe tranſportations and raviſhing joyes that other Chriſtians ſpeak of. If thou canſt not ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. yet bleſs God, if thou canſt but breath forth ſuch language as that, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Say not thou haſt no Grace, becauſe of the high attainments of ſome Hypocrites, who in ſome things may excell thee. When ſome perſons read the ſixth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> they are ſtartled to ſee to what a glorious height the Hypocrite may ſoar; not conſidering that there are theſe three things wherein they excell the moſt glorious Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in the world. (1) That Self was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned in Hypocrites, as it is in them. All that an Hypocrite doth is for himſelf. (2) The Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite never hated every ſin, as he doth; but hath ſtill ſome <hi>Agag, Rimmon,</hi> or <hi>Delilah.</hi> (3) That the Hypocrite never acted in duty from the bent and inclination of a new nature, taking delight in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly imployment, but is moved rather as a Clock by the weights and poiſes of ſome external motives and advantages.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conclude not you have no Grace, becauſe you grow not ſo ſenſibly, as ſome other Chriſtians do. You may be divers wayes miſtaken about this. (1) You may meaſure your growth by your deſires and then it appears nothing; for the Chriſtian aim high, and graſps at all. (2) Or by comparing your
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:110122:36"/>ſelves with ſuch as have larger capacities, time, and advantages then you. (3) Or by comparing your Graces with other mens Gifts, which you miſtake for their Graces. (4) Or by thinking that all growth is upward in joy, peace, and comfort; whereas you may grow in mortification and humility, which is as true a growth as the former. Oh! take heed of theſe miſtakes; they have been very prejudicial to the peace of many Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Decline not ſufferings when God gives you a fair call to them.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>5</label> Oh! the Chriſtians ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time is commonly his cleareſt and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable time.

               <p>THe next thing conducing to our actual readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ſufferings, is the improvement of Faith to ſome conſiderable degree of ſtrength. This is the Grace that muſt do the main ſervice in ſuch an hour, and hath the principal hand in ſupporting the Chriſtian under every burden. This is the Grace that crowns our heads with victory in the day of battel, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Above all taking the ſhield of Faith.</hi> It's true every Grace is of uſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes aſſiſtance: ſuffering Saints have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:110122:37"/>to them all. But of this we may ſay, as <hi>Solomon</hi> of the vertuous woman. <hi>Though many Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have done excellently, yet this excels them all.</hi> In this Grace ready <hi>Paul</hi> was eminent. It was the life he daily lived, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Oh it is a precious grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. ſo precious that Chriſt, who ſeldome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired at any thing, yet wondred at this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.10. A victorious Grace it is that overcomes all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.23. By this Sword it was that all thoſe famous <hi>Heroes, Heb.</hi> 11. atchieved all thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conqueſts: and in every diſtreſs it may ſay to the Soul, as Chriſt to the Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> This is that <hi>Sword</hi> that hath obtained ſo many Victories over the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. and that truſty <hi>Shield</hi> that hath quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many deadly Darts of temptation, as have been levell'd at the very heart of the Chriſtian in the day of battel. By it a Chriſtian lives, when all outward ſenſible comforts die, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. It's the ground upon which the Chriſtian fixes his foot, and never fails under him, 2 <hi>Con.</hi> 1.24. The neceſſity of it will more clearly appear, by conſidering how many wayes it relieves the ſoul in trouble, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthens the heart of all its ſinking loads and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, there are two things that ſink a mans Spirit when under ſufferings; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the troubles, and the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of the ſoul to bear them; againſt both which Faith relieves the ſoul; <hi>viz.</hi> by making a weak ſoul <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and heavy troubles <hi>light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, It makes a weak Soul ſtrong and able to bear; and this it doth divers ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By purging out of the Soul thoſe enfeebling and weakning Diſtempers; not onely <hi>guilt</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which is to the Soul, as a Wound upon the bearing ſhoulder, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. The removal, when it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:110122:37"/>enables the Soul to bear any other Burden, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.24. But it alſo removes <hi>Fear,</hi> the Tyrant Paſſion that cuts the Nerves of the Soul. For, as Faith comes in, ſo Fear goes out: Look in what degree the Fear of God is aſcendant in the Soul, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably the ſinful fear of the Creature declines and vaniſheth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.12, 13. This fear extinguiſhes that, as the Sun-ſhine puts out fire: <hi>The Righteous i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> bold as a Lion,</hi> Prov. 28.1. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a young Lion in his hot bloud, that knows no ſuch thing as fear: And look how much of the Soul is <hi>empty</hi> of Faith, ſo much its <hi>filled</hi> with fear: <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little Faith?</hi> Mat. 8.26. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it's a rare advantage, to be freed from the <hi>common diſtraction,</hi> in times of <hi>common deſtruction:</hi> and this advantage the Soul hath by Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſtrengthens the Soul to bear afflictions and hardſhips, not onely by purging out its weakning Diſtempers, but by turning it ſelf to Chriſt, in whom all its ſtrength lyes; and that ſuitably to the ſeveral Exigencies of the Soul, in all its Diſtreſſes. Doth Darkneſs, like the ſhadow of Death, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the Earth, and all the Lights of Earthly Comforts diſappear, then Faith ſupports the Heart, by <hi>looking to the Lord,</hi> Mic. 7.7. and this look of Faith exceedingly revives the Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.5. and enlightens the Soul. Doth God pluck away all Earthly Props from under your Feet, and leave you nothing viſible to reſt upon, in that Exigence Faith puts forth a ſuitable act, <hi>viz. Reſting or ſtaying upon God,</hi> Eſa. 26.3. and by this the Soul comes to be quieted and eſtabliſhed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.1, Do Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtrive to put off the Soul from Chriſt, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it from leaning upon the Promiſe? Then it puts forth <hi>an act of Reſolution,</hi> Job 13.15. and ſo breaks its way through that diſcouragement. Or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:110122:38"/>hath the Soul been long ſeeking God for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of trouble, and ſtill there is ſilence in Heaven, no anſwer comes; but inſtead of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, comes a Temptation, to throw up the Duty, and ſeek to deliver it ſelf? Then Faith puts forth another act upon Chriſt, ſuitable to this diſtreſs, <hi>viz. An act of waiting,</hi> Iſa. 49.23. which <hi>waiting</hi> is oppoſed to that <hi>ſinful haſte</hi> which the Soul is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to, Iſa. 28.16. Or doth God at any time call the Soul forth to ſome difficult ſervice, againſt which the Fleſh and Carnal Reaſon diſpute and plead? now Faith helps the Soul, by putting forth <hi>an act of obedience,</hi> and that whilſt Carnal Reaſon ſtands by diſ-ſatisfied, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. And hence it is, that Obedience carryes the name of Faith upon it, to ſhew its deſcent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. Faith encourages the Soul to obey, not onely by urging Gods <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> but by giving it Gods <hi>Warrant</hi> for its Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pnity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. Or doth a poor Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever find himſelf over-match'd by Troubles and Temptations, and his own inherent ſtrength begin to fail under the burden? then Faith leads him to an Omnipotent God, and ſo ſecures him from fainting under his Trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61.2. in the Lord is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſtrength. <hi>El Shaddai,</hi> is a name of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a feeble Soul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.29, 30, 31. And thus you ſee the firſt particular made good, <hi>viz.</hi> What a ſtrengthning influence it hath into a weak Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place, let us ſee how it <hi>lightens</hi> the Chriſtians Burden, as well as <hi>ſtrengthens</hi> his back to bear.</p>
               <p>And certainly, this Grace of Faith doth ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alter the very Nature of Sufferings, taking away both the <hi>heavineſs</hi> and <hi>horrour</hi> of them; and this it doth divers ways:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By committing the buſineſs to Chriſt, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110122:38"/>the matter with him; and ſo quitting the Soul of all thoſe anxieties and perturbations, which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e very burden and weight of Affliction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>5. For certainly, that which ſinks us in dayes of Trouble, is rather from within, from our unruly, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and clamorous Thoughts, then from the Troubles themſelves with which we conflict: But by committing the matter to God, the Soul is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By diſcovering much preſent good in our Troubles; the more good Faith diſcovers in a Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the more ſupportable and eaſie it makes it to the Soul. Now Faith brings in a comfortable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that they are not <hi>onely evils,</hi> as the Troubles of the wicked are, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.5. but have an allay and mixture of much good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By fore-ſeeing the end and final removal of them, and that near at hand, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. That which daunts and amazes men in times of trouble, is, that they can ſee no end of them. Hence the heart ſaints, and hands hang down through diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But now Faith brings the joyful Tidings of the end of Troubles, and ſaith to the Soul, <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my Soul? and why ſo diſquieted and diſcouraged within me? as if thy Travails were like the Sufferings of the Damned, endleſs and everlaſting, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are but for a moment. Yet a little, a very little while, and he that ſhall come will come, and will not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Heb. 10.37. Yet a little while, and then the days of thy mourning ſhall be over.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By comparing our ſufferings with the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others, which exceedingly diminiſheth and ſhrinks them up: Sometimes the Believer compares his ſufferings with <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and then he is aſhamed that ever he ſhould complain and droop under them. Oh! ſaith he, What is this to that which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110122:39"/>the Lord Jeſus ſuffered for me? he ſuffered in all his <hi>Members,</hi> Head, Hands, Side, Feet, from all <hi>hands,</hi> Friends and Enemies, in all his <hi>Offices:</hi> Yea, in his Soul as well as Body: And indeed the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Soul, were the very ſoul of his ſufferings: ſometimes he compares them with the ſufferings of others, of the Saints in former Ages: When he reads in Faith, the Hiſtory of their Perſecutions, he is ſhamed out of his Complaints, and Faith. <hi>Am I better then my Fathers?</hi> Sometimes he compares them with the ſufferings of the Damned: <hi>Oh what is this to the everlaſting Burnings! What is a Priſon to Hell? How light and eaſie is it to ſuffer for Chriſt, in compariſon of thoſe ſufferings which are from Chriſt?</hi> And thus the Soul is quieted, and the terrour of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings abated.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Faith intitles Chriſt to the Believers ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and puts them upon his ſcore; and ſo it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly transforms and alters them: Ah! it's no ſmall relief, when a man can hold up the Bible, as that <hi>Martyr</hi> did at the ſtake, and ſay, <hi>Here is that which hath brought me hither:</hi> Or, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt, For thy ſake we are killed all the day long:</hi> Or, as the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Col. 1.24. <hi>I fill up that which is behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt in my fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, Faith engages the preſence of God, to be and abide with the Soul, in all its ſolitudes and ſufferings: It layes hold upon the Promiſes made to that purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>John</hi> 14.18. and whileſt a poor Soul enjoys this, the very ſenſe of Troubles is ſwallowed up.</p>
               <p>And thus I have given ſome brief hints, how Faith relieves and ſtrengthens the Soul in a ſuffering hour: The next thing is to direct you, how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this excellent Grace, that it may do you ſuch ſervice as this in a time of need: And, in order
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110122:39"/>thereunto, I ſhall give you theſe ſeven Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Attend diligently upon the Miniſtration of the Goſpel, which is not onely the procreant, but alſo the conſerving cauſe of Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> is the Food and Nutriment of the <hi>Grace of Faith:</hi> There are its Rules, its Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, its Cordials: Thence Faith takes and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures up its <hi>Michtams,</hi> to which it hath recourſe in times of need: Every <hi>Attribute, Command,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> that ſhines forth there, is a Diſh for Faith to feed on, all together are a Royal Feaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5.5. Some ſay the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> is called <hi>the Land of the Living,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. in reſpect of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God which that people enjoyed: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, they are the great Inſtruments of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Souls at firſt, and preſerving that life it ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat in them: But then be ſure they have Chriſts ſtamp upon them, and that they be miniſtred by his own Officers, and in his own way: And ſo you may reaſonably expect more Fruits and Influences from them, than from all private gifts and helps in the World: <hi>For the Lord loveth the Gates of</hi> Zion, <hi>more then all the dwellings of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.2. and all private helps may ſay, in compariſon of Chriſts publique Ordinances, as <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid to the men of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Judg. 8.2. <hi>What have we done in compariſon of you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Improve well your <hi>Sacrament-ſeaſons,</hi> thoſe <hi>Harveſt-days</hi> of <hi>Faith:</hi> This <hi>Ordinance</hi> hath a direct and peculiar <hi>tendency</hi> to the improvement and ſtrengthning of Faith: It is a Pledge ſuperadded to the Promiſe for Faiths ſake: Heavenly and ſublime Myſteries do therein ſtoop down to your Senſes, that you may have the clearer apprehenſions of them; and the clearer the apprehenſions are, the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:110122:40"/>ſtronger the aſſent of Faith muſt needs be: By this Seal alſo the Promiſe comes to be more ratified to us; and the firmer the Promiſe appears to the Soul, the more bold and adventurous Faith is in caſting it ſelf upon it: Oh! how many poor doubting trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Souls have in ſuch a Seaſon, gathered the full ripe Fruits of Aſſurance, from the Top-boughs of that Ordinance!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Frequent actings of Faith, are rare and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all means of improving it: <hi>To him that hath</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi>) that improves and uſes what he hath, <hi>ſhall be given, Mat.</hi> 25.29. This was the way by which <hi>Paul</hi> thrived in Faith, and every other Grace ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, that he out-grew them that were in Chriſt before him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. It's true, that its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Soul, is not after the manner of other Habits, either <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Natural:</hi> This is not of <hi>Natural acquiſition,</hi> but by <hi>Divine Infuſion;</hi> but yet its improvement is in the ſame manner. Oh then! if ever you would have a flouriſhing Faith, rouze it up out of the dull Habit, and live in the daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Go to Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of Faith,</hi> and cry to him, as <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord increaſe my Faith:</hi> Yea, beg the aſſiſtance of others Prayers in this behalf, as the Apoſtle did, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. Faith animates Prayer, and Prayer increaſes Faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Improve times of affliction for the increaſe of Faith: For certainly, ſanctified afflictions do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably exerciſe and increaſe this Grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. In times of Proſperity, we ſee not what ſtock of Faith we have: We live ſo much upon things ſeen, that we cannot many times tell whether we have Faith or no: But when difficult days come, then we muſt let out our whole ſubſiſtence and livelyhood
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:110122:40"/>by Faith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. Yea, then we have many Proofs and Experiments of Gods fidelity in the Promiſes, which is a choice help to Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Keep Catalogues of all your remarkable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences; treaſure them up as food for your Faith in time to come: Oh! it is a ſingular encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and heartning to Faith, when it can turn over the Records of Gods dealing with you in years paſt, and ſay as <hi>Joſuah, Not one thing hath failed,</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuah 23.14. When it can ſay ſo of Promiſes, that have already had their accompliſhments, then they will be apt to ſay concerning thoſe yet to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, as <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſaid to <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 1.45. <hi>Bleſſed is the Soul that believeth, for there ſhall be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe things which are told it by the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Experiments are the Food of Faith. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.14. <hi>Thou brakeſt the Heads of</hi> Leviathan <hi>in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and gaveſt him to be meat to thy People inhabiting the Wilderneſs,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi>) That famous Experience of the Power and Love of God in their Red-Sea Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, where he deſtroyed that Sea-Monſter <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Hoaſt, was meat to the Faith of Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs afterwards. We often find Chriſt charging the Peoples unbelief on a bad Memory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.8, 9. And hence it was, that the Lord commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to keep <hi>Journals</hi> of every Days <hi>Occurrences, Numb.</hi> 13.1, 2. It's a thouſand pities, ſuch choice helps ſhould be loſt. Oh! if you could but remember, how the Lord hath appeared for you in former Exigencies, and how often he hath ſhamed you for your unbelief, it would exceedingly animate your Faith, both in preſent and future Diſtreſſes, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.5.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, Beware of ſenſe, which is the ſupplanter of Faith. O if you live upon things earthly, you put Faith out of its Office: things earthly have an
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:110122:41"/>enmity to Faith. <hi>This is the victory by which we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, even our Faith,</hi> 1 John 5.4. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming notes a conflict, and conflicts infer oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. Oh you that liveſ o much by ſight and ſenſe on things viſible, what will you do when in <hi>Davit</hi>'s or <hi>Pau</hi>'s caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. when all outward encouragements and ſtayes ſhall utterly fail. What had <hi>Abraham</hi> done, if he had not been able to believe againſt hope, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſuch an hope as is founded in ſenſe and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Reader, I adviſe and charge thee in the Name of the Lord; and as thou hopeſt to live when viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comforts die, that thou be diligent in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and preparation of this excellent Grace of Faith: if it fail, thou faileſt with it; and as thy Faith is, ſo art thou. Conſult all this Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and ſee if thou canſt find a man among them, that did not atchieve this Victory by his Faith. Had they not all been run down by the furious aſſaults of temptation, and inſtead of a <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> been ſo many <hi>Pillars of Salt,</hi> and Monuments of reproach and ſhame to Religion, if their Faith had failed in its trial.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Wherein the neceſſity and uſefulneſs of Chriſtian forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in order to ſufferings, is evinced; with a brief account of its nature, and the means of attaining of it.</hi>

               <p>THe next Grace which concurs to the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our actual readineſs for ſufferings, is <hi>Chriſtian Fortitude,</hi> or holy courage; which muſt ſay in thy heart in a time of danger, as <hi>Elijah</hi> once
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:110122:41"/>did, <hi>As the Lord lives I will ſhew my ſelf.</hi> This alſo is a choice part of your preparation work. In this Grace our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was eminent. When he was told, <hi>Bonds and Afflictions waited for him;</hi> he could ſay, That <hi>none of thoſe things moved him,</hi> Acts 20.24. yea, when he was to appear before the Lion <hi>Nero,</hi> and not a man would own or ſtand by him, yet he ſtands his ground, reſolving rather to die on the place, then diſhonourably to recede from his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and profeſſion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16, 17. He ſet the world, with all its threats and terrours, lower then it ſet him. Oh how conſpicuous was this Grace in all thoſe <hi>Heroes</hi> that have paſt on before us! And if ever you hope to ſtand in the evil day, and be fetched off the Field with honour, you muſt rouze up and awaken your courage for God: And the neceſſity thereof will appear upon theſe four con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſucceſs and prevalence of Satans temptations in the hour of perſecution depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the fainting and overthrow of this Grace. Wherefore doth he raiſe perſecutions in the world, but becauſe ſuch terrible things are fitted to work upon the paſſion of carnal fear, which riſes with thoſe dangers, and makes the ſoul as a tumultuous Sea. This is it he aims at, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.13. This is a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying paſſion, that repreſents dangers more and greater then they are, and ſo drives the ſoul into the very net and ſnare laid by the Devil to take it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25. <hi>The fear of man brings a ſnare;</hi> which was ſadly exemplified in <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12.12. and divers others of the Saints. If he can but ſubdue this Grace, he will quickly bring you to capitulate for life and liberty upon the baſeſt and moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable terms; therefore the preparation of this Grace is ſo exceedingly neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:110122:42"/>2. Becauſe this is the Grace that honours Jeſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> view. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. God, Angels, and Saints wait to ſee the glorious triumphs of their Faith and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, reflecting honour upon the Name and Cauſe of Chriſt. Devils and wicked men gape for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by their cowardiſe. Certainly very much lies now upon the Chriſtians hands. Should he faint and give ground, how will it furniſh the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of Hell, and make Chriſts enemies vaunt over him, as if his love ran ſo low in the hearts of his people, that they durſt not adventure any thing for him: or as if notwithſtanding their brave words and glorious profeſſion, they durſt not truſt their own principles when it comes to the trial! But if now they play the men, and diſcover an holy gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Spirit and reſolution for Chriſt, how will it daunt the enemies, and make them ſay as <hi>Marcus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aretheuſa</hi> made out of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Nobles, preſent at his torments, to ſay concerning him, <hi>We are aſhamed, O Emperour; the Chriſtians laugh at your cruelty!</hi> And how will God himſelf rejoyce and glory over them, as he once did over <hi>Job</hi> when he fetch'd him with honour off that firſt Field! <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. <hi>Still he holdeth faſt his integrity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Your own peace is wrapt up in it, as well as Gods glory. Is it nothing think you, to be freed from thoſe <hi>Vultures</hi> and <hi>Harpyes,</hi> that feed upon the hearts of men at ſuch times? Surely God reckons
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:110122:42"/>that he promiſeth a very great mercy to his people, when he promiſeth it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. Pſal.</hi> 112.7. When <hi>Borromaeus</hi> was told of ſome that lay in wait to take away his life, it troubled him not; but he ſaid, <hi>An Deus eſt in mundo pro nihilo?</hi> What, is God in the world for nought? And like to this was the anſwer of <hi>Silentiarius</hi> in a like caſe; <hi>Si Deus mei turam non habet; quid vivo?</hi> If God take not care for me, how do I live? Oh this is it that brings you to an holy quietude of Spirit in times of confuſion and diſtraction, which is a choice mercy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your magnanimity is of ſpecial uſe to other Saints, who are following you in the ſame path of ſufferings. If you faint, it's like the fainting of a Standard-bearer in an Army: You bring up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an evil report upon the Croſs of Chriſt, as the <hi>firſt Spies</hi> did upon the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And a like influence with that it is like to have on your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; ſo that there is a neceſſity of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Grace alſo, before you can ſay with <hi>Paul</hi> you are ready.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But what is this Chriſtian fortitude, and wherein doth it it conſiſt?</p>
               <p>I anſwer briefly. It is an holy boldneſs in the performance of difficult duties, flowing from Faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now there are ten Rules heedfully to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the breeding of holy courage in the breaſt of a Saint in evil times.</p>
               <p>And the firſt Rule is this:
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>1</label> Get a weaned heart from all earthly enjoyments. If the heart be inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately fixed upon any one thing that you poſſeſs in the world, that inordinate eſtimation and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it will ſtrangely effeminate, ſoften, and cowardize your Spirit when your trial comes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. You meet not with a man of courage for God, but had his heart dead to earthly things; ſo it was with <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.8. Since the Apoſtles dayes we ſcarce meet with a greater example of holy magnanimity then <hi>Luther;</hi> and if you read his ſtory, you will find few men ever ſet a lower rate on the world then he.

We are apt to call it prodigality, and are grown wiſer to husband our lives and comforts, better then they did.

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Diſcovering the neceſſity of an Heart mortified to all Earthly and Temporal Enjoyments, in order to the right managing of a ſuffering condition: with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Directions for the attaining thereof.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE next thing wherein your actual readineſs for Bonds or Death conſiſteth, is, in the <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of your Affections to all Earthly Intereſts and Enjoyments, even the beſt and ſweeteſt of them:</hi> Till this be done, in ſome meaſure, you are not fit to be uſed in any ſuch ſervice for the Lord, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. The living World, is the very Life of Temptations: The travailing pains of Death, are ſtronger and ſharper upon none, than thoſe that are full of Senſe and Self. As you ſee in Nature, what Conflicts and Agonies ſtrong and lively perſons ſuffer when they die: When others, in whom Nature is decay'd and ſpent before-hand, die away without half that pain, even as a Bird in the ſhell. Corruption in the Saints, is like the Sap in green Wood, which reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fire, and will not burn well, till it be dryed up. Prepared <hi>Paul</hi> had an Heart mortified in a very high degree, to all the Honour and Riches of the World, accounting them all but Trifles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4.</p>
               <p>The need of this will be evinced by theſe five Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unleſs the Heart be mortified to all Earthly enjoyments, they will appear great and glorious things in your eye and eſtimation: and if ſo, judge what a Task you will have, to deny and leave them
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:110122:46"/>all in a ſuffering hour. It is Corruption <hi>within,</hi> that puts the Luſter and Glory upon things <hi>without:</hi> It's the Carnal Eye onely that gazes admiringly after them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. And hence the <hi>Luſt</hi> is put, to expreſs the <hi>Affection,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. becauſe all that inordinate affection we have to them, ariſes from our high eſtimation of them, and that eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from our Luſts, that repreſent them as great and glorious: Therefore certainly, it will be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult (if not impoſſible) to deny them, till they have loſt their glory in your Eye; and that they will never do, till thoſe Luſts within you, that put that Beauty and Neceſſity upon them, be firſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. As for inſtance, What a Glory and Neceſſity doth the Pride of Men put upon the Honour and Credit of the World, ſo that they will rather chooſe to die, than ſurvive it! but to a mortified Soul it's a <hi>ſmall matter,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. So for Riches, how much are they adored, till our Luſts be mortified, and then they are eſteemed but <hi>Dung and Droſs, Phil.</hi> 3.8. 'Tis our Corruption that paints and gilds over theſe things: When theſe are crucified, thoſe will be lightly eſteemed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mortification of Corruptions, is that which recovers an healthful ſtate of Soul: Sin is to the Soul, what a Diſeaſe is to the Body; and Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is to ſin, what Phyſick is to a Diſeaſe. Hence thoſe that are but little mortified, are in a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe called <hi>Carnal,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. and <hi>Babes, verſ.</hi> 2. in reſpect of weakneſs. Now, ſuffering Work being ſome of the Chriſtians hardeſt Labour and Exerciſe, he cannot be fitted for it, until his Soul be in an healthful ſtate: A ſickly man cannot carry heavy Burdens, or endure hard Labours and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes: The ſick Souldier is left behind in his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:110122:46"/>or put into the Hoſpital, whileſt his Fellows are dividing the ſpoils, and obtaining glorious Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories in the Field. To this ſenſe ſome expound <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die; but of ye, through the Spirit, mortifie the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi> Where, as <hi>Death</hi> is put to note a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſtate of Soul, whileſt Mortification is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: So <hi>Life</hi> is put to expreſs an healthful and comfortable ſtate; <hi>vivere pro valere;</hi> ſo that upon this account alſo the neceſſity of it appears.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your <hi>Corruptions</hi> muſt be mortified, elſe they will be raging and violent in the time of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and like a Torrent, ſweep away all your Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Reſolutions. It's ſin unmortified within, that makes the Heart like Gun-powder; ſo that when the Sparkles of Temptation fly about it, (and they fall thick in a ſuffering hour) they do but touch and take. Hence, the <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>through Luſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. With theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal unmortified Luſts, the <hi>Tempter</hi> holds corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence: and theſe be the <hi>Traytors</hi> that deliver up our Souls into his hands.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Unleſs you be diligent and ſucceſsful in this Work, though you ſhould ſuffer, yet not like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, you will but diſgrace Religion, and the Cauſe for which you ſuffer: For it's not ſimple ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſuffering <hi>as a Chriſtian,</hi> that reflects Credit on Religion, and finds acceptation with God. If you be envious, fretful, diſcontented, and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, under your ſufferings, what Honour will this bring to Chriſt? Is not this altogether unlike the Example of your Lord? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. and the behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of ſuffering Saints? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. Yet thus it will be, if your Pride, Paſſion, and Revenge, be not firſt ſubdued: For what are the breakings forth of ſuch diſtempers of Spirit, but as the fluſhes of Heat
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:110122:47"/>in the Face from an ill-affected Liver? Moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that all theſe Evils are in your Natures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Mortification muſt be ſtudied and ply'd with diligence; elſe you will find many Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Hankerings after Earthly Enjoyments and Comforts, which will prove a ſnare to you: What is ſin, but the <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>vitiated appetite</hi> of the <hi>Creature,</hi> to things that are Earthly and ſenſual, reliſhing more ſweetneſs and delight in them, than in the bleſſed God? And what is Sanctification, but the rectifying of theſe <hi>inordinate affections,</hi> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them in their proper Object? A regenerate and mortified Chriſtian taſts not half that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in forbidden fruits that another doth: Set but Money before <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſee how eagerly he catches at it. — <hi>What will ye give me, and I will betray him.</hi> Set but Life, Liberty, or any ſuch Bait before an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified Heart, and how impotent is he to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, as offered in a Temptation. On theſe unmortified Luſts! how do they make men hanker, long, and their Lips water (as we uſe to ſay) after theſe things? This makes them break Priſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline ſufferings, though upon the baſeſt tearms: Whereas a mortified Chriſtian can ſee all theſe things ſet before him, yea offered to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35. It is with them much as it was with old <hi>Barzillai,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.35. when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is decayed, they find but little pleaſure in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural actions, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. And look as the Body of ſin decays and languiſhes, ſo do theſe Longings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: It weans the Soul from them all, and enables it to live very comfortably without them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:110122:47"/>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12. There needs no more to be ſaid, to evince the neceſſity of Mortification, and diſcover what influence it hath into a Chriſtians readineſs for ſufferings.</p>
               <p>It remains therefore, that I open to you ſome of the principal <hi>Corruptions,</hi> about which it moſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you, to beſtow pains e're ſufferings come. Now look as there are four principal Enjoyments, in which you are like to be tryed, <hi>viz. Eſtate, Name, Liberty, Life;</hi> ſo the Chriſtians Work in ſuffering times, lies in mortifying theſe four ſpecial <hi>Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, viz.</hi> Firſt, The Love of the World. Secondly, Ambition. Thirdly, Inordinate affectation of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and pleaſure. Fourthly, Exceſſive love of life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the love of this World, away with it, crucifie it, crucifie it: Down with this Idol, and let it be dethroned in all that intend to abide with Chriſt in the hour of Temptation: How elſe will you take the ſpoiling of your goods? How will you be able to part with all for Chriſt, as theſe bleſſed Souls did? It grieves my heart to ſee how many Profeſſors of Religion are carryed captive at the Chariot Wheels of a bewitching World. Oh! good had it been for many Profeſſors, if they had never taſted ſo much of the ſweetneſs of it. <hi>Sirs,</hi> I beg you, for the Lords ſake, down with it in your <hi>Eſtimations,</hi> down with it in your <hi>Affections,</hi> elſe Temptations will down with you e're long. I ſhall offer five or ſix Helps for the crucifying of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider your Eſpouſals to Chriſt, and how you have choſen and profeſſed him for your Lord and Husband: Therefore, your doting upon the World, is no leſs than Adultery againſt Chriſt, <hi>James</hi> 4.4. If Chriſt be your Husband, he muſt be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110122:48"/>a <hi>Covering to your Eyes;</hi> an unchaſte Glance upon the World wounds him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The more you prize it, the more you will be tormented by it: Did you prize and love it leſs, it would diſquiet and vex you leſs: It's our doating on it, that makes it draw blood at parting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Get true <hi>Scripture-notions</hi> of the World, and rectifie your Judgments and Affections by them: If you will have the <hi>true Picture</hi> and <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation</hi> of it drawn by the Hand of God himſelf, ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. It's nothing elſe but <hi>Luſt</hi> that puts that <hi>Lnſter</hi> upon it: It hath but a <hi>Phantaſtick Glory,</hi> and that alſo paſſeth away: What is become of them that ruffled it out in the World but one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago? What could the World do for them? Are they not all gone down to the ſides of the Pit? <hi>But he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Study and contemplate Chriſt, and the things above more: This would vail all its Glory, and kill it at the Root, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. Juſt as a man that hath been gazing upon the Sun, when he takes off his Eye from that bright and glorious <hi>Creature,</hi> and looks to the <hi>Earth,</hi> there is a Vail of Darkneſs overſpreading the Face of it, that he can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I wonder how ſuch as pretend to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and enjoy communion with God, can ever reliſh ſuch ſweetneſs in the World, or have their Hearts enticed and captivated by it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Remember always, that by your love and delight in worldly things, you furniſh the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with the chiefeſt Bait he hath to catch, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy your Souls. Alas! were your Hearts but dead to theſe things, he would want an Handle to catch hold on. What hath he more to offer you, and

               </head>
               <p>THE hazards and dangers of Chriſtians, in times of Perſecution, ariſe not ſo much from their Sufferings, as from the Temptations that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attend, and are by Satan planted upon their Sufferings: for the moſt part, Sufferings and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations go together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. And therefore, it behoves ſuch as are, or expect to be called to Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to dive into the Myſteries of Temptations, and be well acquainted with the Enemies Deſigns upon them. So was <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo he ſuppoſes all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be, that ingage in the ſame Cauſe; <hi>We are out ignorant of his Devices,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. There is a manifold advantage redounding to ſuffering Saints thereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that is well acquainted with the Methods of Temptation, will be the better able to deſcry the firſt approaches and beginnings of it; and a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation diſcovered, is more then half conquered. It is a ſpecial Artifice of Satan, to ſhuffle in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations as undiſcernably as may be into the Soul; for he knows, that <hi>in vain is the Net ſpread in the ſight of any Bird,</hi> Prov. 1.17. And therefore, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily makes a ſuffering ſeaſon, to be a tempting
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:110122:52"/>ſeaſon; becauſe as ſufferings do, like Fire to Iron make it impreſſive and operable, ſo they do ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily put the Soul into an hurry and diſtraction, and ſo gives him an advantage, to tempt the Soul with leſs ſuſpicion, and greater ſucceſs. But now, a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtian, that is acquainted with his Wiles, will diſcern when he begins to <hi>enter into temptation;</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. He that is well acquainted with Satans Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of tempting, will not onely diſcern it ſoone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are many poor Souls that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under ſtrong Temptations, and know not what to do: They go up and down complaining, from Chriſtian to Chriſtian, whileſt the Judicious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian plyes the <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> with ſtrong Cries<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Devils Work in raiſing Perſecution, is but as the Fowlers work, in beating the Buſh in the Night, when the Net is ſpread to take the Birds, which he can affright out of their Coverts. He that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands this, is not eaſily moved by the ſtrongeſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from his Place and Duty; and ſo is like to prove the moſt conſtant and invincible Chriſtian in Times of Perſecution.</p>
               <p>Oh then how neceſſary is it, that ſince all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions are intended as means to promote Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation: and that skill and inſight into theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Sathan, ſo advantages us to fruſtrate his Deſigns in both?

               <p n="1">1. It lies in the kind and nature of the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf: For it's moſt certain, that all Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110122:53"/>are not alike forcible and dangerous. Some are ordinarily more ſucceſsful then others; and ſuch are theſe that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Strange and unuſual Temptations, I mean no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch as none have been troubled with before us; for there is not a Dart in his Quiver, but hath been let fly at the Breaſts of other Saints, before it was level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at ours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. But by ſtrange and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, I mean ſuch, as the People of GOD are but rarely troubled with, and poſſibly we were never exerciſed with before. Theſe are the more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe they daunt and amaze the Soul, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily beget deſpondency, even as ſome ſtrange Diſeaſe would do, that we know not what to make of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mark them for moſt dangerous Temptation, that are <hi>adapted</hi> and ſuited to your proper ſin, or <hi>conſtitution-evil.</hi> For certainly, that is the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Nick and <hi>Criſis</hi> of Temptation when it tryes a man there. Now if he be not truly gracious, he falls by the Root irrecoverably, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.5, 6. Or if ſincere, yet without ſpecial aſſiſtance, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary vigilance, he falls ſcandalouſly, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. compared with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When it is a <hi>Spiritual Temptation,</hi> which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes undiſcernably out of a Chriſtians Duties. This is the leſs ſuſpected, becauſe Temptations uſually come from the ſtrength and livelyneſs of <hi>Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> but this, from the Slaughter and Conqueſts we make of them. Duties, and enlargements in them, which are the Poyſon of other Luſts, proves the Food and Fewel of this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7, 8. And how much the more covert and cloſe any Temptation is, by ſo much the more dangerous it is.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:110122:53"/>2. The ſtrength and efficacy of temptation lies much in the skill and policy of Satan in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of it: And hence they are called wiles, methods, and deviſes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. and himſelf an old Serpent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9. And amongſt the reſt of his deep and deſperate ſtratagems theſe following are remarkable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In imploying ſuch inſtruments to manage his temptations as are leaſt ſuſpected, and have the greateſt influence. A <hi>Teacher, Gal.</hi> 2.14. a <hi>Wife, Gen.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Job</hi> 2.9. <hi>Friends, Acts</hi> 21.13. The Devil knows it is a bad buſineſs, and therefore muſt make the beſt of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the orderly diſpoſition and ranging of his temptations; beginning with little things firſt, and then by degrees working over to greater. His firſt motions are commonly moſt modeſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. Should he diſcover the depth of his deſign at firſt, it would ſtartle the Soul, and make it reply as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fael, Am I a Dog that I ſhould do thus?</hi> It's far eaſier to gain his end by parts, then putting for all at once.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In endeavouring to engage the Soul upon his own ground. I mean to tempt him from his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Duty where God ſet and expects to finds him. He knows while you are with God, God is with you, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.2. Whilſt a man abides there, he abides with God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24. Whilſt he is there, the Promiſe is a good breaſt-work to keep off all his darts: And therefore as Fiſhers, when they have ſpread their Net in the River, beat the Fiſhes out of their coverts and caverns, ſo doth Satan.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In not preſenting the temptation, till the Soul, be prepared to receive it. He loves to ſtrike when the iron is hot. He firſt lets their troubles come to an height, brings them to the Priſon, Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:110122:54"/>or Fire, and then offers them deliverance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35, 37. This <hi>Mirrour</hi> furniſhes you with many inſtances of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In tiring out Souls with the long continuance of temptations. What he cannot win by a <hi>ſuddain ſtorm,</hi> he hopes to gain by a <hi>tedious ſiege.</hi> Forty days together he aſſaulted the Captain of our ſalvation, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.13. And truly it's a wonder the Soul yields not at laſt, that hath been tried long, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. When the <hi>rod of the wicked lies long upon the back of the righteous, it is much if he put not forth his hand to iniquity</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. In falling moſt violently upon them, when they are loweſt and moſt proſtrate in their ſpririts and comforts: So he aſſaulted <hi>Job</hi> with a temptation to curſe God and die, when he ſate in that deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate upon the dunghill, <hi>Job</hi> 2.8, 9. He loves to fall upon us as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> did upon the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemites,</hi> when we are ſore and wounded: And therefore ordinarily you find times of <hi>divine deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to be times of <hi>diabolical temptations.</hi> So that look as the wild Beaſts of the Deſart come out of their Dens in the night, and then roar after their prey, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.20. ſo doth Satan when the Soul ſeems to be benighted and loſt in the darkneſs of Spiritual troubles.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſecond thing wherein the efficacy and ſtrength of temptation lies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, it lies in that ſecret correſpondency Satan holds with our boſome enemies. Were it not for this <hi>domeſtick Traitor,</hi> he could not ſurpriſe us ſo eaſily: As you ſee in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he could do nothing, becauſe he found nothing to faſten a temptation on. He was like a <hi>Chryſtal glaſs</hi> filled with pure Fountain water: So that though he ſhould have been agitated and ſhaken never ſo much by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet no filthy ſedement could appear; but now
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:110122:54"/>we have an enemy within that holds intelligence with Satan without; and this would prove a <hi>Devil</hi> to us, if there were no other <hi>Devil</hi> to tempt us, <hi>Jom.</hi> 1.14, 15. It's a Fountain of temptation in it ſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19. and the chief inſtrument by which Satan doth all his tempting work, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>Our ſeveral paſſions and affections are the handles of his temptations. Every thing ſaith <hi>Epictetus</hi> hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, two handles to take it by. Our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the handles of our Souls. The temptation of Self-confidence, and Pride, takes hold of a during and forward diſpoſition; the temptation of Apoſtacy upon a timerous diſpoſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe imbred luſts go over to the Enemy in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and fight againſt the Soul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. This is a more dangerous Enemy, then the Devil. 'Tis true, they both work againſt us, but with a double dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference. Satan works <hi>externally,</hi> and <hi>objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> but Luſt <hi>internally,</hi> and <hi>phyſically</hi> (i. e.) <hi>que ad materiale,</hi> as it's capable of phyſicall effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. <hi>Sin wrought in me all manner of concupiſcency, Rom.</hi> 7.8. Yea 'tis a ſubtil Enemy that doth his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs politickly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Sin deceived me;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes with a kiſs, ſtrangles with a <hi>ſilken halter, Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. Theſe be his Agents ſitting at the <hi>Council Table</hi> in our own breaſts, and there carrying on his deſigns effectually: Yea, it's a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and perpetual Enemy, no ridding your hands of him. Satan is ſometimes put to flight by reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. and ſometimes ceaſes his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.13. but when he ceaſeth to <hi>tempt</hi> and <hi>inject,</hi> this ceaſeth not to irritate and ſollicite: Where we are, it will be; it's our ſad lot to be tied to it, and perpetually aſſaulted by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. We may ſay of it, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſaid of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> That it's never quiet, whether a <hi>Conquerour,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:110122:55"/>Yea, it's a potent Enemy too, it hauls men away to the commiſſion of ſin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. In ſeizeth the Magazeen of the foul, and delivers up the Arms; I mean the Members to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, weapons of unrighteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee wherein the efficacy and power of temptation conſiſts. And it mightily concerns you that are, or expect to be Sufferers for Chriſt, to be acquainted with theſe things, and know where the ſtrength of your Enemy lies.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall the ſuffering Saint ſo manage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Suffering hour, as not to be captivated by temptations. This brings me upon the ſecond thing I promiſed; <hi>viz.</hi> to preſcribe ſome Rules for the eſcaping or conquering of thoſe temptations that are incidental to a ſuffering ſtate. And firſt:</p>
               <p>Labour to cut off the advantages of temptations before they come.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>1</label> It's our inordinate love to life, eſtate, liberty, and eaſe, that gives the temptation ſo much ſtrength upon us. Do not overvalue them, and you will more eaſily part from them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. O mortifie ſelf-love, and creature-love; let your heart be looſened and weaned from them, and then the temptation hath loſt its ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Secure to your ſelves an intereſt in the heavenly glory.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>2</label> When once you clearly ſee your propriety in the Kingdome above, you will ſet the lighter and lower by all things on earth. That is a pregnant Text to this purpoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. It's our darkneſs and uncertainties about thoſe, that make us cling ſo faſt to theſe.</p>
               <p>Settle this principle in your heart,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>3</label> as that which you will never depart from, that it's better for you to fall into any ſuffering, then into the leaſt ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25. This all will acknowledge, but how few practice it! Oh that you would practically un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:110122:55"/>and receive it! Sufferings is but a <hi>reſpective, external,</hi> and <hi>temporal</hi> evil; but ſin is a univerſal, internal, and everlaſting evill.</p>
               <p>Believe that God hath curſed and blaſted all the wayes of ſin,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>4</label> that they ſhall never be a ſhelter to any ſoul that flies for refuge to them, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.35. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.15. The way of Tranſgreſſours is an hard and difficult way. There is no ſecurity in the way of iniquity. He that runs from ſuffering to ſin, runs from the apparent to the reall danger; from the painted to the living Lion.</p>
               <p>Live up to this principle,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>5</label> that there is no policy like ſincerity and godly ſimplicity. This will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and ſecure you, when carnall wiſdome will expoſe and betray you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.2. <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. Sinfull policy never thrives with Saints.</p>
               <p>Conſider ſadly what the conſequents of yielding up your ſelves to temptation will be:
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>6</label> The Name of God will be dreadfully reproached, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. A fatal ſtumbling-block is laid before the blind world, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.36. the hearts of many up-right ones made ſad, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.3. The fall of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour is as when a Standard-bearer fainteth; and a dreadfull wound it will be to thine own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.76. One hours ſleep of ſecurity, may keep you many dayes and nights waking upon the Wrack of honour.</p>
               <p>Never engage a temptation in your own ſtrength,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>7</label> but go forth againſt it trembling in your ſelves, and relying on divine Aids and Aſſiſtances, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10. What are you to grapple with Spirits, to enter the Liſts with <hi>Principalities and Powers?</hi> or what is your ſtrength that you ſhould hope?</p>
               <p>Let the dayes of your temptation,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>8</label> be dayes of ſtrong cries and ſupplication. Thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:110122:56"/>12.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.4. Your beſt poſture to wreſtle with Temptation, is upon your knee.</p>
               <p>Dwell upon the conſideration of thoſe choice encouragements God hath laid up in the Word for ſuch a time.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>9</label> As (1) though he give Satan leave to tempt you, yet you are ſtill in his hand to preſerve you, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.3. <hi>John</hi> 10.28. (2) That whilſt Satan is ſifting and trying you on Earth, Chriſt is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding for you in Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31, 32. (3) That an eternal reward is laid up for thoſe that overcome, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.28, 29, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7, 8. And now is this reward to be won or loſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Be content till God open a door out of your temptations, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. The time of the Promiſe will come, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.17. Wait for it, though it tarry, and ſeem to be deferred; in the end it will ſpeak, and not lye, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. There was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret door in the Ark, though it could not be ſeen whileſt the waters prevailed: And ſo there is in all your temptations, though at preſent it be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable by you.</p>
               <p>And thus I have brought you one ſtep nearer to <hi>Paul</hi>'s bleſſed frame. Oh give diligence to this work.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Sheweth that a choice part of our preparation and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for ſufferings, conſiſts in the improvement of our praying abilities, and keeping cloſe with God in that heavenly and excellent duty in dayes of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; wherein alſo of the nature and means of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>PRayer is ſaid to be amongſt Duties, as Faith is amongſt the Graces. Doubtleſs it is of ſpecial uſe and ſervice at all times to a Chriſtian; but yet in ſuffering dayes it is of more then ordinary uſe and neceſſity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. and therefore is reckoned among thoſe choice pieces of Armour which ſuffering Saints are to put on, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. I will here briefly diſcover the neceſſity of it, and then ſhew you that a Chriſtian may improve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to an excellent degree in it; and laſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſome means for ſuch an improvement.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of it to a ſuffering Saint will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively appear if you conſider;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this duty is the out-let of troubles, and the beſt way the poor Chriſtian hath to eaſe his heart when ſurcharged with ſorrow. Griefs are eaſed by Groans. Such evaporations disburthen and cool the heart, as the opening of a Vein in ſome caſes doth. Oh the ſenſible eaſe that comes in this way! When grief in the mind, like vapours in the Air, are condenſed into black Clouds, that overſpread the Soul, and darken that beautifull Light that once ſhone there, then Prayer like the Sun diſpells and ſcatters them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. Many a Saint by Prayer hath ſucked the breaſt of a Promiſe, and then fell
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:110122:57"/>aſleep by Divine contentment, in the boſome of God. A time may come, when thy heart ſhall be ready to break with trouble, and not a friend to whom thou canſt open and eaſe it: and then bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God for Prayer, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.5, 6, 7. That which ſinks others is, That when troubles fill and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm their hearts, they try what Reaſon, merry Company, or outward Comforts can do: but alas! this is to palliate a cure, it returns again with the more violence: but this gives ſenſible relief, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. <hi>title, Pſal.</hi> 62.8. For firſt, this opens and gives a vent to troubles, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.12. (2) It gives our troubles a diverſion, and ſo a cure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.1. and laſt <hi>verſ.</hi> compared. Yea (3) by praying over them, they are not onely diverted but ſanctified, and ſo ceaſe to be diſtracting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it gives a vent to our troubles, ſo an in-let to unſpeakable comforts and conſolations. See a pregnant inſtance of this, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.25. For (1) here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they obtain gracious anſwers from the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their troubles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. In this alſo they meet the gracious ſmiles of God which ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up their troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. And laſtly, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they engage the temper of God to open a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and effectual door out of all their troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.4, 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Prayer begets and maintains holy courage, and magnanimity in evill times, when all things about you tend to diſcouragement. It is your being with Jeſus that makes you bold, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.13. He that uſes to be before a great God, will not be afraid to look ſuch little things as men are in the face. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man clothed with the Sun, had the Moon under her feet. And what need you have of courage in evil times, hath been already ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is a duty you may perform at any time,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110122:57"/>or in any condition: No Adverſary can cut you off from it. It cannot be ſaid ſo of many other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. None can hinder the intercourſe betwixt Heaven and your Souls. You may perform it in a Priſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25. in a baniſhed condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61.2. and ſo is fitted for a ſuffering condition.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, you muſt ſtrive to excell in this, foraſmuch as no Grace within, or Service without can thrive without it. God hath ordained the whole work of Grace to grow up to perfection this way, <hi>Jude</hi> 19.20. He will have all mercies fetched out this way, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11, 12, 13. All that comes from God to you, or to you from God, muſt come in this Channell. Be convinced then, of the need you have to improve your ſelves herein, as ever you hope to ſtand in the evil day.</p>
               <p>But how are theſe praying abilities capable of improvement in the people of God?
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label>
               </p>
               <p>Praying abilities are either externall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or elſe internal and ſpeciall:
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> The external and common ability, is nothing elſe but that dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and skill men get, to expreſs themſelves to God in Prayer, which men have by nature or induſtry. Thus many can put their meaning into apt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent expreſſions, to which the Spirit ſometimes adds his common touches upon the affections. And this Hypocrites reſt and glory in. Or elſe they are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and internal, whereby men are enabled to pour out their ſouls to God in a ſaving manner. And this may be conſidered either in the <hi>Habit</hi> or <hi>Act.</hi> The Habit is given by the Spirit, when the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Grace are firſt infuſed into the ſoul, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. By being ſanctified we are made near, and by acting thoſe principles in Prayer we are ſaid to draw near, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. Now in our actual drawing near to God, the Spirit hath the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:110122:58"/>chief and principal hand: and his aſſiſtance therein is threefold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He excites the heart to the duty; 'tis he that whiſpers to the Soul to draw nigh to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſuggeſts the matter of our Prayers, and furniſheth us with the Materials, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us as to the matter, not onely to what is lawful, but alſo to what is expedient for us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſtirreth up ſuitable Affections in Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. and hence thoſe groans and tears, thoſe gaſpings and vehement anhelations. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all our Abilities, both habitual and actual, be from the Spirit, and not from our ſelves, yet are they capable of improvement by us: For though in reſpect of acquirement, there be a great difference betwixt natural and ſupernatural Habits, yet their improvement is in the ſame way and manner; and this improvement may be made divers wayes. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Though you have the Spirit, and can pray, yet you may learn to pray more humbly then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Though you riſe no higher as to words, yet you may learn to lay your ſelves lower before the Lord, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You may learn to pray with more ſincerity then formerly: Ah! there is much <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie</hi> and <hi>Formality</hi> in our <hi>Prayers,</hi> much of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, &amp;c. Now, you may learn to pour out more <hi>Cordial Prayers.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You may learn to pray with more zeal and earneſtneſs then before: Some Saints have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, and been remarkable for this, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. <hi>James</hi> 5.16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, With more aſſiduity and readineſs at
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:110122:58"/>all times for it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Praying alwayes,</hi> with all Prayer. Hence Chriſt gives that commendation to the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Thy Lips, O my Spouſe, drop as the Honey Comb:</hi> The <hi>Honey Comb</hi> often drops, but always hangs full of Drops ready to fall.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, You may learn to pray with more Faith: Oh the Qualms of Unbelief, that go over our Hearts in a Duty! Faith is the Soul of Prayer, and according to the Faith God finds in them, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and values them. Now in all theſe things, you may improve your ſelves abundantly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By being more frequent in the Duty, <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. acquaint thy ſelf with the Almighty; in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is, <hi>accuſtom thy ſelf:</hi> Thoſe that have been excellent, have alſo been abundant in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By taking heed that you grieve not the Spirit, on whoſe influences and aſſiſtances, you ſo intirely depend: Even as much as a Ship doth upon the Gales of Wind for its motion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By honouring the Spirit which enables you to pray, and that eſpecially two ways; (1) By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on him; go not forth in your own ſtrength to the Duty, truſt not upon your own promptneſs, or preparations. (2) By returning, and with thankfulneſs aſcribing the praiſe of all to him: Be humble under all Enlargements: Say, <hi>Not I, but Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By ſearching your own Hearts, and examining your Neceſſities and Wants, when you draw nigh to God; this will be a Fountain of Matter, and give you a deep Reſentment of the worth of Mercies pray'd for.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, By looking more at the exerciſe of Graces, and leſs at the diſcovery of Parts; by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for Impreſſions more, and pumping for
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:110122:59"/>Expreſſions leſs. And thus I have briefly ſhewed you, how to furniſh yourſelves with this needfull Qualification alſo.</p>

               <p n="2">2. It is the great deſign of God in the Goſpel, to exalt his Son, and to have all glory attributed and aſcribed to him, <hi>That in all things be might have the preheminence,</hi> Col. 1.13. That Chriſt <hi>might be all in all,</hi> Col. 3.11. Hence, no Saint muſt have a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, or be truſted with a ſtock as <hi>Adam</hi> was; but Chriſt being filled with all the fulneſs of God,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:110122:60"/>and made the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or firſt Receptacle of all Grace: <hi>For it pleaſed the Father, that in him all fulneſs ſhould dwell;</hi> all the Saints are therefore to go to him for Supplies, and of his fulneſs to receive, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. This fulneſs being a <hi>Miniſterial fulneſs,</hi> like that of the Sun, or of a Fountain, intended to ſupply all our wants. And hence is it that Faith, a ſelf-emptying and denying Grace, is appointed to be the Inſtrument of fetching our Supplies from Chriſt. All muſt be derived from him, that all the praiſe and glory may be aſcribed to him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.14. And this is a moſt wiſe and congruous Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; for hereby not onely are his People the better ſecured, but by this alſo the reproach that lay upon Chriſt is rolled away: He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached on Earth, as barren, empty, weak. <hi>Can any good come out of</hi> Nazareth? He was looked upon as a <hi>Root ſpringing out of a dry ground;</hi> but by this ſhall his Reproach be wiped away: So that unleſs you will go about to croſs the great deſign of God, in the exaltation of his Chriſt, you muſt go out of your ſelves, and humbly, and conſtantly rely upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from Chriſt, and his grace to help in the times of need.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Chriſtian is conſtantly to depend upon Chriſt, notwithſtanding all his own preparations, and inherent qualifications; becauſe the activity even of inherent Grace depends upon him: Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Grace is beholden to exciting and aſſiſting Grace for all it is enabled to do. You cannot act a Grace without his Spirit,
<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 15.5. It may be ſaid of Grace in us, as it was of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> Deut. 11.10, 11, 12. <hi>It is not as the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>whence ye come out, where thou ſowedſt thy ſeed, and wateredſt it with thy foot, as a Garden of Herbs: But a Land of Hills and Vallies, drinking water of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:110122:60"/>Rain of Heaven, a Land which the Lord thy God careth for: his Eyes are always upon it, from the beginning of the year, even to the end of the year.</hi> As the life and fragrancy of Vegetables, depends on the Influences of Heaven, ſo do our Graces upon Chriſt. And hence, he is called, (1) a Root, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.10. (2) An Head, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. (3) A Sun, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. (4) A Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. all which Compariſons do fully carry this Truth in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, In this life of dependance lies your ſecurity: And indeed, this is the great difference, betwixt the two <hi>Covenants:</hi> In the firſt, <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſtock was in his own hands, and ſo his ſecurity or miſery depended upon the unconſtrained choice of his own mutable and ſelf-determining Will: But now in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> all are to go to Chriſt, to depend upon him for ſupplies, and ſo are ſecured againſt all deſtructive dangers, <hi>Jude</hi> 1.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. Should you go forth in your own ſtrength againſt a Temptation, either your Grace would fail, and you fall in the Conflict: Or if you obtain any Victory over it by your own ſtrength, yet it's a thouſand to one but your Pride would conquer you, when you had conquered it: Like him that ſlew an <hi>Elephant,</hi> but was himſelf ſlain by the fall of that <hi>Elephant</hi> which he ſlew. But now, by this way, as God hath ſecured you againſt the Dangers without; ſo alſo the frame and conſtitution of this <hi>New Covenant</hi> is ſuch, as prevents the danger ariſing from our own Pride too. Not, <hi>Ego, &amp; Deus meus;</hi> I and my God did this: as was once ſaid by a prophane Mouth; <hi>But Self is abaſed, and the Lord lifted up in his own ſtrength,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. And thus I have briefly evinced the neceſſity of this daily dependance.</p>
               <p>But next it concerns you to know, what this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance we ſpeak of is: This alſo I ſhall briefly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:110122:61"/>open to you, laying down ſomewhat <hi>negatively,</hi> and ſomewhat poſitively about it.</p>
               <p>It is not to deny the Grace wrought in us by the Spirit;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Neg. </seg>1</label> this were both injuſtice and ingratitude: We may know our own Graces ſo, as to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them, though not ſo as to be proud of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</p>
               <p>It is not a la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> excuſe from our duty:
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Neg. </seg>2</label> You do not <hi>depend,</hi> but rather <hi>diſhonour</hi> Chriſt by ſo doing. You muſt not ſay, Becauſe Chriſt muſt do all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt do nothing: but rather work out your ſalvation, becauſe it's he that worketh both to will and do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. Theſe are noi <hi>oppoſed,</hi> but <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then poſitively, it lies in three things.</p>
               <p>In ſeeing and acknowledging the infinite ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and fulneſs that is in Chriſt:
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Poſit. </seg>1</label> To acknowledge him to be all in all; not onely by way of <hi>Impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> procuring all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. but alſo by way of <hi>Application,</hi> bringing home to the Soul all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings purchaſed by his blood, and ſetling us in the poſſeſſion of it, <hi>John</hi> 14.3. and ſo from firſt to laſt to eye him as the Authour and Finiſher of our Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In ſeeing the neceſſary dependance that all our Graces have upon him. That look as you ſee the Stream depending on the Fountain, the Beam upon the Sun, the Branch upon the Root, the Building upon the Foundation, even ſo do our Graces upon Chriſt: On him they live, and cut off from him they die. <hi>Our life is hid with Chriſt in God, Col.</hi> 3.3. When you ſee this, and alſo ſee that all your activity and ſtriving is but as the hoyſting up of the Sails, in order to the motion of the Ship, which can do nothing till there come a Gale: When you look upon your Grace as a Creature that muſt be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:110122:61"/>upheld, fed, acted, and preſerved by Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. Then you are prepared for this act of dependance: As for inſtance; You can never depend upon Chriſt for the acting of that Grace of Hope, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you ſee Chriſt to be the prop and foundation of it, and that it depends upon him, as upon its <hi>cauſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. as upon its object, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.19. and as upon its <hi>foundation</hi> and ground-work, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27.</p>
               <p>You can never depend upon Chriſt for your joy and comfort, untill you ſee what a neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance this alſo hath upon him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. and that both as to its being and acting, <hi>John</hi> 16.22.</p>
               <p>You can never depend upon him for ſtrength in any duty, untill you ſee how your duties depend upon Chriſt, not onely for the <hi>ſtrength</hi> by which they are performed, <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5. but alſo for <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cettation</hi> when they are performed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. It were eaſie to inſtance in any other Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It lies in

                     </gap>, Looking off to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of our Faith.</note> looking off from your own Grace, whenever you are put upon the acting off it, (I mean in regard of any dependence upon it) and looking by an eye of Faith and acceptation to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. To the putting forth of which acts of dependance upon Chriſt, holy ejaculations in our on-ſets upon duty, or thoſe quick and vige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lifting up of our ſouls to God that way are of ſpecial uſe, it being a duty fitted for the purpoſe, when there is no room for ſet and ſolemn Prayer. And thus briefly of its nature.</p>
               <p>And to urge you to this duty, I ſhall offer theſe ſeaven Conſiderations; which oh that they might prevail upon your hearts, and make you for ever to claſp and cling about Chriſt more then ever you have done.</p>
               <p>You have little reaſon to rely upon the ſtrength

How often are the common Gifts of the Spirit miſtaken for his ſpecial Graces! The ſixth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is able to make a man tremble in this thing.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe you have much Grace,

               <p>Well then, by all this be perſwaded to ceaſe from your ſelves, yea from your religious ſelves; and to all other your preparations, adde this as a choice one: If you do theſe things, you ſhall never fall. And thus you ſee the compleat Chriſtian in his equipage for ſufferings.</p>

And I doubt not but your judgements and conſciences vield to the evident neceſſity of theſe things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have placed the Chriſtians readineſs. But alas! where ſhall we find among the throngs and crowds of Profeſſours, any conſiderable numbers thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and prepared? To ſuffer for Chriſt, is a gift that few have received. We are fallen into the dregs of time. Oh how little of the Primitive zeal and ſimplicity remains among the Profeſſours of this Age! Later times have produced a ſort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of another ſtamp and Spirit. Theſe have the <hi>light,</hi> but they had the <hi>love:</hi> theſe <hi>ſee</hi> more, but they <hi>did</hi> and <hi>ſuffered</hi> more. How many that are an ornament to Religion, do adorn themſelves with the name of it!</p>
               <p>Now according to this account given of a ready Chriſtian, divers profeſſing perſons will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of their unreadineſs and inability to manage ſuffering work; As firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The politick and hypocritical Profeſſours, whoſe hearts were never <hi>ſet right</hi> at firſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> when trials come, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.8. Their hearts were never <hi>ſound in Gods ſtatutes,</hi> and therefore no wonder if they be not onely a <hi>ſhame</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:110122:63"/>to, but <hi>aſhamed of</hi> their profeſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.80. Never wonder if you ſee that profeſſion which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> to end in <hi>apoſtacy.</hi> Theſe want their habitual readineſs for ſufferings, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not drink of that cup: needs muſt they fall when tried; and when they fall, they fall dreadfully, and often irrecoverably; for they neither have the <hi>ſeed of God in them,</hi> nor any <hi>promiſe</hi> of God made to them.</p>
               <p>And are there not many ſuch to be found in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place? For (1) how difficult is it to perſwade many of you to any duty that hath loſs or hazard at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on it. Doth not the ſincere heart ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable and diſpoſed to all the known will of God? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. Do Chriſtians uſe to enquire more what is cheap, eaſie, and ſafe for them, or what is their duty? <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. Speak Conſcience, for to thee I do appeal; Art thou not conſcious of ſome reſerves, limitations, and exceptions? Doth not the man like <hi>Naaman</hi> deſire the Lord to excuſe and pardon him in this or that thing? 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.17. And thinkeſt thou that this is conſiſtent with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience which excepts no duty, nor quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with any command, becauſe they all flow equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ſovereignty of God? <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.11. and ſo doth what it doth <hi>intuitu voluntatis,</hi> upon the ſight of Gods will. Say Conſcience, Are there not great ſtruglings, diſputes, and conteſts betwixt thee, and fleſhly intereſts in ſuch caſes? and art thou not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently over-born? Oh ſearch your hearts in this particular.</p>
               <p>Yea ſecondly, I appeal to you, whether there be not many among you that chooſe ſin rather then affliction? This is alwayes the Hypocrites opinion and choice. He judges ſufferings the greateſt evils, and ſo orders himſelf in his election. It was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid perſecution that thoſe Hypocrites, <hi>Gal.</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:110122:64"/>6.12. conſtrained others to be circumciſed, onely to gratifie the <hi>Jews;</hi> that ſo by a ſinfull compliance with them the offence of the Croſs might ceaſe. If <hi>Paul</hi> would have done ſo, he might have avoided it too, but he durſt not whatever he ſuffered, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.11. Oh this is a ſhrewd ſign of a falſe heart, <hi>Jub</hi> 36.21. and the contrary diſpoſition is always found in the upright heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.</p>
               <p>Nay, are there not ſome that have, and others that are ready to throw up their Profeſſion, when they ſee into what difficulties it involves them? Whileſt they could live upon the profeſſion of Truth, they entertained it; but when Truth comes to live upon them, they thruſt it out, and cry, Away with this Profeſſion, it will beggar and undo us: They then repent of their forwardneſs, and ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with they had never engaged in it. O examine whether your hearts be not thus turned back, and your ſteps declined. If ſo, it's manifeſt you are hypocritical Profeſſours, and that it was ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſelf-reſpect that firſt engaged, you in your Profeſſion, but can never enable you to hold out when difficult dayes come. I ſay it's manifeſt by this departure from your Profeſſion, that ſome outward ſelf-reſpect at firſt allured you to it. As now when I behold the artificial motions of the Wheels in a <hi>Watch,</hi> and ſee how regularly the Needle marks the journal hours of the Sun upon the flat of the <hi>Quadrant,</hi> and ſee nothing that moves or guides it, it would cauſe admiration if I had never ſeen it before, or did not underſtand the cauſe of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but when I look upon the other ſide, and there find Wheels, Reſſorts, and Counterpoiſes, and a Spring that cauſes all thoſe motions, I ceaſe to wonder; certainly ſome Luſt or other was the ſpring of all thy religious motions; ſtop or take
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:110122:64"/>off that, and motion ceaſes: And if it be ſo, this <hi>Scab</hi> of Hypocriſie will at laſt break out into the <hi>Botch</hi> of Apoſtacy. Thou canſt never hold out long under Trials, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.21. Oh how many ſuch ſad ſights may we live to ſee as Trials come! Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult times are coming on, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. and woe to ſuch then as want ſincerity at the bottome of their Profeſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as theſe have no habitual readineſs for ſufferings, and conſequently muſt be ruin'd by them; ſo there are others that may be truly godly, and have the root of the matter in them, who are yet far from an actual readineſs, and ſo continuing, are like to be a reproach to Religion when their Trial comes. For it is not a little Grace in the ſleepy habit that will ſecure you from falling ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly by the hand of temptation: And although that Seed of God which is in you, will recover you again, and prevent total and final Apoſtacy, yet oh conſider what a ſad thing it is to enter into, and be conquered by temptation: to be led away in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph by the Tempter, and made a reproach to Chriſt. O it's a ſad conſideration to think how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there be amongſt the people of God, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover little or no actual preparation for ſufferings, As firſt;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon how many of the Saints is the Spirit of ſlumber poured out: Even the wiſe as well as fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſeem now to be aſleep. There is a twofold ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſleep; the firſt is <hi>total,</hi> upon wicked men: and it's one of Gods ſoreſt and dreadfulleſt ſtrokes upon their ſoul,

The other is <hi>partial, Cant.</hi> 5.2. and is incident to the people of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.5. This is nothing elſe but that torpor and ſluggiſhneſs of ſpirit which ſeizeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saints, and never did it prevail, I fear among them, more then now. For where is their activity for God? Where is he that <hi>ſtirreth up</hi> himſelf to take hold of God? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7. Where is there ſuch a generation as that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.6. we pray, confer, and hear for the moſt part, but as men ſpeak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſleeping and waking. Where can you find, except here and there one, that hath a quick and lively ſenſe of Gods indignation upon him, or that trembles at his judgements? Is not that the very caſe of the moſt which God deſcribes? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. How many are ſeized by a private and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit, every man turning to his own houſe, and eagerly purſuing the world? <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 45.4, 5. Oh! how are we intangled in the Wilderneſs? how doth the World eat up our time, and eat out our Zeal, cowardize and ſoften our ſpirits, and render us utterly unfit for the Yoak and Burden of Chriſt? You that ſee ſo much Beauty, and taſte ſo much ſweetneſs in the Creature, will have an hard Tugg when call'd to deny it: You are not yet prepared to drink of the Cup, or take up the Croſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How many poor Chriſtians are of a low and timerous ſpirit, ready to tremble at the ſhaking of a Leaf: Ah poor hearts! how unfit are you for Bonds or Death? This paſſion of fear that ſo predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in you, is the very paſſion that Satan aſſaults, and layes ſiege to in the hour of Temptation, as was before noted: and commonly it's occaſioned (where it flowes not from the <hi>Natural Conſtitution</hi>) from an exceſſive love to the world, or from ſome
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:110122:65"/>guilt upon the ſpirit. It's true, the Lord can ſo aſſiſt weak Faith, and ſo ſubdue ſtrong Fears, as that you may be enabled to ſtand the ſhock when it comes: (for, as I noted formerly, our ſtrength lies not in any thing inherent in us, but we are ſtrong or weak, according to the divine preſence and aſſiſtances that we enjoy) but yet if you labour not to mortifie this Evil, and ſtir not up your ſelves in the uſe of all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means, to rouze your Zeal and Courage for God, I know no Warrant you have to expect ſuch aſſiſtances.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, how many poor Chriſtians among us, are to this day dark and cloudy in their Evidences for Heaven? Had they walked cloſely with God, been laborious in the diſquiſition and ſearch of their own hearts, they had long ſince obtained a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſatisfaction about the ſtate of their own hearts: But as the caſe ſtands with them, how unfit are they for Bonds or Death. Oh! 'tis a ſad caſe, when inward and outward Troubles meet together, as you may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21, 22. when there ſhall be <hi>fightings without,</hi> and <hi>fears within:</hi> When ſuch a pang as that, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.17, 18. ſhall come over thy heart, what wilt thou do?</p>
               <p>By all that hath been ſaid, it appears, that the moſt of Profeſſours are in a very unready poſture for ſufferings: So that as Troubles come to an height, we are like to ſee many ſad Spectacles: Many Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences will come; Religion is like to be wounded in the houſe of it's friends. Oh! What a day of Mercy have we enjoyed? What helps and choice advantages, above any precedent Age, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready? How ſad and inexcuſable is this?</p>

Chriſt layes our conſtancy and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance very much upon our fore-caſting the worſt that may fall out, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28. <hi>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand, Epheſ.</hi> 6. He that hath firſt ſevered Chriſt in his thoughts from all worldly advantages, and put the caſe thus to his own ſoul, O my ſoul, canſt thou embrace or love a naked Chriſt? Canſt be content to be impoveriſhed, impriſoned, and ſuffer the loſs of all for him? He is moſt likely to cleave faithfully to him, when the caſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſented to him indeed. And can it ſeem a light thing in your eyes, to be enabled to ſtand in ſuch an evil day? If you fall away from Chriſt, then all that you have wrought is loſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13. <hi>Gideons</hi> one <hi>Baſtard</hi> deſtroyed all his ſeventy Sons. This act renders all former actions and profeſſions vain. If you fall, you ſhall thereby be brought into a more perfect bondage to the Devil then ever, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.23. Yea, ordinarily
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:110122:67"/>Apoſtates are judicially given up to be Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. and are ſeldome or never recovered again by Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 6. They that lick up their vomit, ſeldome caſt it up any more. It is a fall, within a little as low as the unpardonable ſin, whence never any riſe again. In ſome caſes the <hi>Judge</hi> will not allow the <hi>Offender</hi> his Book. And is it not then a choice and deſirable mercy to eſcape and prevent ſuch a fall as this is? O good Souls, ply your prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration-work cloſe then.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This will beſt anſwer the Grace of God, in affording you ſuch choice helps and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages as you have enjoyed. How long have you enjoyed the free liberty of the Goſpel, ſhining in its luſter among you? This Sun which to ſome other Nations hath not riſen, and to divers on whom it hath ſhined, yet it is but as a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Sun, remote, and its Beams but feeble: But you have lived as it were under the <hi>Line,</hi> It hath been over your heads, and ſhed its rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt influences upon you. Yea, Gods Miniſters, who are not onely appointed to be <hi>Watchmen, Ezek.</hi> 3.17. but <hi>Trumpeters</hi> to diſcover danger, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.8. theſe have faithfully warned you of a day of trouble, and given you their beſt aſſiſtance to make you ready for it. And is not their joy, yea life bound up in your ſtability in ſuch a day of Tryal? Doth not every one of them call upon you in the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Therefore my Brethren, dearly Beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, ſo ſtand faſt in the Lord my dearly beloved.</hi> Will it not cut them to the very heart, if after all their ſpending la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours among you, they ſtill leave you unready?
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:110122:68"/>Enemies ſtill to the Croſs of Chriſt, impoſſible to be reconciled and perſwaded to ſuffering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I remember I have read of the <hi>Athenian Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus,</hi> who being informed by the <hi>Oracle,</hi> that the people whoſe King ſhould be ſlain in battail, ſhould be Conquerours: He thereupon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed himſelf, and in a diſguiſe went into the Enemies Quarters, that he might ſteal a death to make his people victorious.</p>
               <p>Oh! how glad would your Miniſters be, if you might conquer, and overcome in the day of temptation, whatever become of their lives and liberties! <hi>Yea, and if they be offered up upon the ſacrifice and ſervice of your Faith, they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and joy with you all.</hi> Such is their zeal and longing after your ſecurity and welfare.

               <p n="4">4. Remember how ready the Lord Jeſus was to ſuffer the hardeſt and vileſt things for you. He had a bitter cup put into his hands to drink for you, into which the wrath both of God and man was ſqueezed out.

But what was that to the humiliation of the Lord of glory?

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Containing the laſt uſe of the point, by way of ſupport, and comfort to poor trembling ſouls, who do take pains to make themſelves ready for ſufferings; but yet finding ſuch ſtrength in Satans temptations, and their own corruptions, fear that all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is in vain, and that they ſhall faint, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriy Apoſtatize, when theis Troubles and Tryals come to an height.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the laſt place, If it be ſuch a bleſſed thing to be ready for Bonds, or Death for Chriſt, this may miniſter much comfort to ſuch ſouls, who though they cannot ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> here did, that they are ready; yet are at work daily upon their own hearts to make them ready, and ſtrive in the uſe of all means to <hi>conquer</hi> thoſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that hinder it, and improve thoſe Graces, in which it mainly conſiſteth. O poor ſoul, what ever preſent unreadineſs or indiſpoſition thou findeſt, and complaineſt of in thine own heart, yet thy condition is ſafe.</p>
               <p>Oh but I cannot be ſatisfied in that.

                  </label> I fear I ſhall be over-borne by Temptations, when they come to an height. I have ſuch experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Deceits and Treacherouſneſs of my own heart, that it ſeems impoſſible to me to do as theſe bleſſed ſouls did, when I come to the like Tryals.</p>
               <p>Its well thou ſuſpecteſt thine own heart,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> and trembleſt in thy ſelf; this ſear will keep thee waking, when others are ſecurely ſleeping. It
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:110122:70"/>was a good ſaying of a Reverend Miniſter,
<note place="margin">Mr <hi>A.H.</hi>
                  </note> now with God, <hi>He that fears to flinch, ſhall never flinch for fear.</hi> It's true, ſeeming grace may be total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. It's granted alſo, that the ſins of Believers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that God ſhould forſake them, and that he may ſuffer grace in them to be ſadly re-bated, and they may fall before a Temptation, as <hi>Peter,</hi> and all the Diſciples did. But that thou ſhalt never be ſeparated from Chriſt, or fall <hi>Totus, a toto, in totum,</hi> utterly away from God, thou mayeſt be abundantly ſatisfied upon theſe 5 or 6 Grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From Gods eternal Electing love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all gracious ſouls are beloved and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, be their graces never ſo weak, or their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions never ſo ſtrong. This is immutable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. and hence its ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.22. <hi>They ſhall deceive (if it were poſſible) the very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</hi> Now this immutable purpoſe of God, is not founded upon any mutable ground or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. Yea, when he
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.</note> Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, he ſaw what thou wouldſt be, and yet that hindred him not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the Covenant of Grace, in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of which thou art wrapped up: This is all thy ſalvation, and all thy hope; it will afford thee abundant ſatisfaction, if thou do but weigh particularly theſe three things about it: 1. That the <hi>Author</hi> of this Covenant is not a <hi>fickle</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a <hi>faithful</hi> God; with whom there is not <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay:</hi> With whom there is no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor ſhadow of turning; whoſe gifts and callings are without repentance; ſo that once within the claſp of this bleſſed Covenant, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:110122:70"/>in it for ever. 2. That God hath eſtabliſhed the Covenant with you in the blood of Chriſt; therefore the <hi>Sacramental Cup,</hi> is called the <hi>Cup of the New Teſtament in his blood, Luke</hi> 22.20. the everlaſting merit and efficacy whereof, gives the ſoul of a Believer the higheſt ſatisfaction imaginable. Laſtly, add to this, That in this Covenant God hath undertaken for us, as well as for himſelf: So that what is a <hi>Condition</hi> in one Scripture, is the matter of a <hi>Promiſe</hi> in another Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From that ſtrict and intimate union that is betwixt Chriſt and thee. And hence its impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thou ſhouldeſt be loſt: For 1. Thy union with his Perſon, drawes intereſt in his Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with it: What ever he is, or hath, it is for thee; for, his eye of Knowledge, arm of Power, bowels of Pity, its all for thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This union with his Perſon, ſecures thy feeble Graces from periſhing, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.14. Thy Graces have an everlaſting Spring. Whileſt there is Sap in this Root, it will aſcend into the Branches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It implies thy Perſeverance, becauſe by this union thou becomeſt an integral part of Chriſts Body, which would be mutilate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, ſhouldſt thou be <hi>cut</hi> off and loſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From the prevalent interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt in the Heavens, for all his Saints, in all their tryals here on Earth: From hence the Apoſtle inferres the certainty of our Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. and a pregnant inſtance of it you have in <hi>Peters</hi> caſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. ſpeaks fully to the caſe. To ſtrengthen this, conſider 1. Who it is that intercedes: Its
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:110122:71"/>Chriſt, whoſe Perſon is moſt dear and ingratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.42. 2. What he intercedes for: Surely for nothing but what is moſt ſuitable to his Fathers will. The will of Chriſt, and his Fathers, do not claſh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.26, 27. Yea, what he prayes for, he prayes not for <hi>gratis,</hi> or asks upon any diſhonourable termes to the juſtice of his Father; but they are all mercies purchaſed and paid for; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear not the failing of your Graces.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From the Spirit of Chriſt which dwelleth and abideth in thee, and hath begun his ſaving work upon thee. I ſay <hi>ſaving,</hi> for elſe it would afford no argument: His common works on Hypocrites come to nothing, but in thee they cannot fail: For 1. His Honotr is pawned and engaged to perfect it. That reproach of the fooliſh Builder, ſhall never lye upon him, that he began to build, but could not finiſh. Beſides, this would irritate, and void all that the Father and the Son have done for thee; both their works are compleat and perfect in their kindes, and the Spirit is the laſt efficient in order of working. 2. Beſides, the grace he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wrought in thee, may give thee yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and fuller aſſurance of its preſervation; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it hath the nature of a <hi>Seal, Pledge,</hi> and <hi>Earneſt</hi> of the whole, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. So that it cannot fail.</p>
               <p n="6">6. From thoſe multitudes of <hi>Aſſertory, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory,</hi> and <hi>Comparative</hi> Scriptures; the rich veins whereof, run through the book of God, as ſo many ſtreams, to refreſh thy ſoul. Of <hi>Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> Scriptures, ſee <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.39. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.28. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19. Of <hi>Promiſſory</hi> Scriptures, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:110122:71"/>54.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.40. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. &amp;c. Of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative</hi> Scriptures, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.14. &amp;c. The principal ſcope of all which, is to ſhew the indefectible nature of true grace in the Saints.</p>
               <p>And now, how ſhould this refreſh thy droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul, make thee gird up the loyns of thy mind! ſince thou doſt <hi>not run as one uncertain,</hi> neither <hi>fighteſt as one that beats the Air,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26. but art ſo ſecured from total Apoſtacy, as thou ſeeſt thou art by all theſe things. O bleſs ye the Lord.</p>
               <p>But the Lord ſeems to be departed from my ſoul; God is afarr off from me,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>2</label> and troubles are near. I ſeem to be in ſuch a caſe as <hi>Saul</hi> was, when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> made war upon him, and God was <hi>departed</hi> from him; and therefore I ſhall fall.</p>
               <p>Not ſo;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> for there are two ſorts of Divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions: The one is <hi>abſolute,</hi> when the Lord utterly forſakes his creature, ſo that they ſhall never behold his face more: The other is <hi>limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and <hi>reſpective,</hi> and ſo he forſook his own Son, and often doth his own Elect: And of this kind, ſome are onely <hi>Cautional,</hi> to prevent ſin; ſome are meerly <hi>Probational,</hi> to try grace; and others <hi>Caſtigatory,</hi> to chaſtize our negligence and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs. Now though I have not a word of comfort to ſpeak in the caſe of total and abſolute Deſertions; yet of the latter, which doubtleſs is thy caſe, much may be ſaid by way of ſupport, be it of which of the three ſorts it will, or in what degree it will. For 1. This hath been the caſe of many precious ſouls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.9. <hi>Job.</hi> 13.24, 25, 26.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:110122:72"/>This was poor Mr <hi>Glovers</hi> caſe, as you will finde in his Story, and it continued till he came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of the Stake: therefore no new, or ſtrange thing hath happened to you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord by this will advantage thee for perſeverance, not onely as they are cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal againſt ſin, but as they make thee hold Chriſt the faſter, and prize his
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4.</note> Preſence at an higher rate, when he ſhall pleaſe graciouſly to manifeſt himſelf to thee again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſhall not abide for ever; its but a little Cloud, and will blow over. It is but for a <hi>moment,</hi> and that moments Darkneſs, uſhers in everlaſting Light, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.7.</p>
               <p>Yea laſtly, The light of Gods countenance ſhall not onely be reſtored <hi>Certainly,</hi> but it ſhall be reſtored <hi>Seaſonably;</hi> when thy Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is <hi>greateſt,</hi> thy Troubles at the <hi>higheſt,</hi> and thy Hopes <hi>loweſt.</hi> He is a God of judgement, and knows how to time his own mercies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.3.</p>
